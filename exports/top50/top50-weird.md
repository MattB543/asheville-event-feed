Multi-venue format with local and touring acts gives it a solid regional draw (magnitude 7) and strong community/social potential (8).

**Score Reasoning:** One-night intimate immersive ritual/performance — very rare and highly unique with strong Asheville-weird vibes and deep participatory social potential, but small-scale local venue keeps magnitude low.

**AI Summary:** An intimate, immersive ritual theater gathering that invites participants to bring regrets and unspoken desires for participatory confessional performance, fostering emotional catharsis and communal witnessing in Little Animals Space's small, evocative room.

<summary>Full Description</summary>

What is it that you’ve been carrying around all this time? The unsaid. The unheard. What desires unexpressed are tip toeing around your heart? Or burning hot and tumultuous behind your rib cage, as embers do? What apology hibernates at the base of your spine, like a winter snake, slowly circling but never rising? What whispers of I love you are just beyond the wall of time, never for your ears, not yet, and you yearn for them? Endlessly. Make your reservation. Bring your regrets. To the mysterious territory of the dying. Come, to the table of the ever after. Asheville Fringe Arts Festival 2026 March 21, 2026 at 2pm March 22, 2026 at 1pm

| Social / Meet People | 6/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** Clearly recurring/regular kids' offering at House of Black Cat Magic (low rarity), but a delightfully quirky, kid-friendly cat-lounge experience that earns an Asheville-weird uniqueness boost; very small, local, ticketed program with limited capacity (low magnitude).

**AI Summary:** Cozy after school story time in a cat lounge where children under 8 hear cat-centric books while socializing with resident panthers; tickets cover one child plus one adult, with a two-child maximum.

| Asheville Weird      | 9/10      |
| Social / Meet People | 7/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** A themed black-cat adoption at a local magic shop is charming but not rare—House of Black Cat Magic runs many similar cat-focused events and this is a small, low‑production local adoption drive with modest draw.

**AI Summary:** Black cat adoption event at House of Black Cat Magic featuring many adoptable black cats from Binx's Home for Black Cats and opportunities to meet and adopt familiars and companions. Ideal for cat lovers and prospective adopters.

Binx's Home for Black Cats and House of Black Cat Magic are bringing the magic of black cats to Asheville so you can find your familiar!

Come join us on Saturday, February 21st at House of Black Cat Magic in Asheville from 12-5PM for our black cat adoption event. We'll have black cats galore of all shapes, sizes, and ages- all familiars looking to find their soul person and forever home. Are you ready to find your familiar?

| Asheville Weird      | 8/10      |
| Social / Meet People | 2/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** A limited-stop touring contemporary circus at the Diana Wortham feels like a special, must-see theatrical run (rarity 7). High-concept, surreal circus/dance gives strong Main Character Energy and earns the Asheville-weird bonus (unique 10, ashevilleWeird 8). Mid-to-high regional draw for a professional touring ensemble at a notable local theater (magnitude 7). Seated theater performance offers little social mingling (social 2).

**AI Summary:** Breathtaking 75 minute blend of contemporary circus, dance, and physical theatre that follows a woman plunged into a surreal world where memories come to life and the ordinary becomes extraordinary.

| Social / Meet People | 6/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** Internationally known experimental turntablist doing a one-off intimate stop at a small, artsy local venue—highly unique and deeply ‘Asheville weird’ (sound sculpture, deep listening). Modest overall draw due to venue size but good niche appeal and social potential.

**AI Summary:** Abstract turntablism and improvised soundscapes weave chance-driven textures with marble-sculpture resonances and multi-channel installation techniques, guided by Deep Listening practices; DJs Sow Servain and Lock In Twin add noir-tinged experimental beats.

<details>
<summary>Full Description</summary>

| Social / Meet People | 6/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** One-night touring stop with a distinctive lineup (vibraphone-led experimental punk-jazz + Ween’s drummer) — pretty missable if you sleep on it but not blockbuster. Very high on novelty and Asheville-style weirdness, mid-level regional draw at Third Room, and a small-club show with decent chances to mingle.

**AI Summary:** Percussion-driven experimental punk jazz and improvisational jam sets led by vibraphone virtuoso Mike Dillon, with guest Ween drummer Claude Coleman Jr., erupting in tight, high energy late night performances.

| Asheville Weird      | 8/10      |
| Social / Meet People | 7/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** One-off walk led by well-known activist Robin Greenfield makes this fairly missable and special (rarity 8); hands-on foraging + food-sovereignty focus is high-concept and gains an Asheville +2 novelty bump (unique 8); held in a local park with community draw rather than a big touring venue (magnitude 5); strongly embodies Asheville’s eco/DIY/weird culture (ashevilleWeird 8); and the small-group, interactive nature makes it good for meeting people (social 7).

**AI Summary:** Explore Carrier Park's spring flora on an outdoor foraging walk led by activist Robin Greenfield, learning edible plant identification, medicinal uses, and practical food sovereignty techniques for urban wild harvesting.

<details>
<summary>Full Description</summary>

For one year Robin Greenfield is foraging every bite of his food and medicine. A year without grocery stores, restaurants, pharmacies or even a garden. “Nature” is his garden!
Is it possible to eat in harmony with Earth and live in reciprocity? Robin wholeheartedly believes so and is putting this love and devotion for Earth into bold action as he harvests the food and medicine that is growing freely and abundantly all around us.

At the Foraging Walk:
Learn how to safely and sustainably forage the common edible and medicinal plants that most of us pass by daily without ever knowing!
Rob will introduce you to:

- Ten or more common edible and medicinal plants growing in your area
- How to safely forage
- How to harvest sustainably and be an ally to the plants
- Simple strategies for successful foraging and plant identification.

All are welcome, regardless of experience. Experienced foragers can come to learn more or to connect with other foragers in the area! Bring as many friends as you’d like and feel free to record.

We will meet at the Garrier Park Shelter from 2:00 PM-5:00 PM
220 Amboy Rd, Asheville, NC 28806

**Score Reasoning:** One-off, late-night fern‑themed psychedelic folk show with immersive forest visuals at intimate Nightshade — very quirky and high concept (hence high Unique and Asheville Weird), but small‑scale venue keeps Magnitude low and social potential moderate.

**Score Reasoning:** A one-day, hands-on coolship/koelschip brewing workshop and tasting at Fonta Flora’s farm is a niche, limited-run experience — highly distinctive and delightfully 'Asheville' (wild yeast, farm barrels), small-scale local draw, and great for mingling during guided tastings.

**AI Summary:** Interactive brewing workshop exploring koelschip (coolship) fermentation techniques, hands on tours of barrels and farm tanks, and guided tasting sessions of small batch mixed fermentation wild yeast sour ales.

| Social / Meet People | 6/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** A one-off performance by a bilingual, experimental sibling duo at intimate Static Age Records—not a recurring weekly act but a single special stop (rarity 7). High-concept, performative synth/spoken-word rooted in magical realism — very novel (unique 9). Small record-shop venue = low draw scale (magnitude 3). Theatrical, ritualized, and literary elements fit Asheville’s quirky arts scene (ashevilleWeird 8). Intimate setting and niche audience make it fairly good for meeting like-minded attendees

**AI Summary:** Bilingual sibling duo weaves atmospheric synths, ritualized movement, and spoken word storytelling drawn from Oaxacan magical realism and speculative science fiction, creating intimate, experimental performance for adventurous listeners.

**Score Reasoning:** A one-off, high-cost outdoor shamanic circle on the Blue Ridge Parkway feels exclusive and missable (rarity 7). Very evocative and high-concept—classic Asheville spiritual/weird energy (+Asheville bonus) (unique 9). Small-group, local draw rather than a large production (magnitude 3). Strongly embodies Asheville’s offbeat, nature-based mysticism (ashevilleWeird 8) and is highly social/intimate for meeting people in a sacred circle (social 8).

**AI Summary:** Drumming, breathwork, and guided intention setting in a sacred circle under mountain pines, blending shamanic healing practices with quiet nature immersion for community focused spiritual grounding.

Small venue/local scale keeps magnitude low (3), while the format—social dancing aimed at mingling—scores high for meeting people (8).

High-concept pairing of lo-fi psych folk with gritty basement rock — plus the local DIY/experimental twist — earns a strong unique score (9, includes Asheville-weird bonus). Intimate record‑store venue = small-scale draw (3). Very much in the Asheville DIY/quirky vein (8). Tight, standing-room show fosters mingling and community vibes (7).

| Social / Meet People | 6/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** One-off, intimate record‑store performance pairing experimental electronica/visuals with a new local collaboration and an operatic vocalist — very distinctive and peak Asheville-weird, but small scale and locally focused so moderate urgency and social draw.

**AI Summary:** Ever evolving experimental electronica and immersive visual performance from infinitikiss meets Blooming's new collaboration of Lynn and Matthew, capped by Asheville vocalist Elisa Faires' classically trained operatic influenced singing in an intimate record store.

<details>
<summary>Full Description</summary>

Featuring: Infinitikiss, Blooming. Blooming is a shoegaze project with Matthew (XOR), Lynn (Farewell Phoenix), Thomas (Serrate, Saturnine) on drums, and Lyn (Saturnine) on bass. There will be a deluge of reverb, delay, and fuzz. It may be difficult to find meaning, shape, or reason. Such as life, in an existential crisis. Forgotten dream- but it’s got a beat, and it be kinda poppy tbh. infinitikiss is an ever-evolving musical and visual recording project conceptualized by Nic Jenkins, featuring a revolving ensemble of curious and experimental artists, musicians, and performers. Elisa Faires is from Asheville, North Carolina, United States and has been singing since she was eight years old. Her early beginnings were rooted in choral singing, and in college she studied opera and classical music as well as electronic music. In fact, one of her teachers was the great Dr. Robert Moog. After studying at the University she spent three years dedicated to her study and singing in Opera and began to pursue a career. As a reaction to her rigorous training in technique and repertoire, she began improvisation with others and started recording and performing her own experimental music.

Niche, mystical content with an Asheville-y vibe gives it above-average uniqueness (base 5 + Asheville weird bonus = 7). Local, professional wellness venue (Wellspring) keeps Magnitude modest (4). Strongly embodies Asheville’s offbeat spiritual scene (8) and is good for meeting others in an intimate group setting (7).

**Have you been feeling stuck in your awakening?**
You’ve done the work, read the books, and practiced the affirmations, the yoga, the retreats, and you've made amazing progress, yet there are certain patterns that keep remaining stubbornly stuck in place.

It’s not just you.

But something magical is happening in the collective consciousness right now.

Waves of light codes are pulling out patterns that have been held by your genetic lineage for centuries.
When you become aware of these codes, you can transform stuck patterns easily.

Join me for **Embody Your Ascension**, a powerful one-day immersion designed to help you tune in, release the past patterns and create space to embody your next phase of authenticity.

---

## The Weight of Invisible Baggage

Living with unresolved ancestral patterns is like trying to run a marathon while wearing a backpack full of rocks. You might be moving forward, but it’s harder than it needs to be.

- Feeling like you've made strides but are struggling to fully integrate?
- Do you feel a deep spiritual calling but feel like you're being pulled in different directions?
- Are there channels you can't identify that are draining your energy?

These are not personal failings. They are energetic imprints waiting to be cleared. If left unchecked, these patterns dim your light and keep you small.
**It is time to put the backpack down.**

<details>
<summary>Full Description</summary>

Now some new things have come to light, and they are rolling around in the ol’ Duder’s head, so pay attention.

In the year of our Dude, 1998 the story of a man from Los Angeles, the city of Angels, unfolded. Sometimes there’s a man, and he’s the man for his time and place. In that time and place, as it could be today, that man was the Dude.

In celebration of that historic event 28 years ago we give you the Day of the Dude Hash. This day where we celebrate all things Dude: Nihilism, 8 year olds (dude), sarsaparilla, following the rules AND crossing the line, zesty enterprises, $1000 for doing (something that can't be mentioned here) and watching, severed toes, and just being out of our element.

Come dressed as your favorite character or prop from the movie. There will be a White [Ukrainian] stop(s), bowling balls, and possibly a little Credence. It’s NOT pet-friendly, so leave your favorite marmot or whatever at home, dude. Be sure to bring along the normal hash stuff, chairs, dry clothes, and your favorite rug to help tie the room together.

**WHERE:** AMF Star Lanes - 491 Kenilworth Rd, Asheville, NC 28805

**WHEN:** Date, Standard start is 2pm gather, 2:30pm Hares away
**HARES:** Body Glide
**HASH CASH:** **_$8._** (**$5** non-alcohol options) for beer only.
**SHIGGY LEVEL:** Probably on the low end... maybe a 1 or 2.

**ON-ON! (your salutation) PLEASE ADVERTISE YOUR TRAIL!**
\*\*All events are intended for those 21 years old and up unless otherwise specified\*\*

| Asheville Weird      | 8/10      |
| Social / Meet People | 9/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** A one-night, facilitated consent-based platonic touch circle is fairly limited (often sells out) and very high-concept/Asheville-quirky, but it’s a small, hyper-local wellness gathering—excellent for making deep social connections though not a large draw.

**AI Summary:** Facilitated consent centered platonic touch sessions focused on nervous system regulation and trust building with guided consent practices in a welcoming circle; optional nonsexual touch and somatic exercises create a grounded, respectful space.

<details>
<summary>Full Description</summary>

## **Safe Space • Real Connection**

**Platonic Snuggles** is a facilitated, consent-centered gathering offering nurturing, platonic touch and authentic connection in a grounded, respectful space.

There is no dating or romantic intention — this experience is designed to support nervous system regulation, trust-building, and honoring personal boundaries. All touch is optional, and all activities are invitations, never obligations.

We begin with a welcoming circle and guided consent practices, followed by gentle connection in a cozy home setting. No prior experience is needed.

Held in a private West Asheville home. Address shared after registration.

### **💜 Energy Exchange**

**$30–$45 sliding scale**

Please secure your spot using the Zeffy [ticket link here](https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/platonic-snuggles-2).

One scholarship and one work-trade spot are available for each gathering. Please reach out privately if support is needed.

Space is limited to maintain an intimate, safe container.

**Score Reasoning:** Recurring community shamanic drum-journey at The Well (multiple upcoming dates) so not super rare; high novelty and ‘main-character’ mystique (Core Shamanism + guided trance) with an Asheville-weird vibe (+bonus); small, intimate local venue so low magnitude; very conducive to connection and group work (strong social potential).

**AI Summary:** Steady drum-driven shamanic journeys through the lower, middle, and upper worlds to meet spirit guides in a communal Core Shamanism circle; bring a blanket, eye pillow, journal, and portable drum for altar offerings.

<details>
<summary>Full Description</summary>

Exploring our consciousness and meeting our guides in the lower world, upper world, and middle worlds. Traveling in the tradition of Core Shamanism via drum beat.

About Ted Riskin
Ted is interested in anything that can get him out of his head, and music and movement do a pretty good job of that. He hopes to offer music that facilitates an inner journey and invitations that create a shift. While he likes modern electronic music, he can’t create a mix without including lots of natural instruments and voices. Due to a short attention span, he mixes in lots of different musical genres. You can hear some of his mixes on [mixcloud.com/tarisk](http://www.mixcloud.com/tarisk.).

\~\~\~

\*\* Please note that the dance starts at Warm up. The doors close promptly at Opening Circle and people who arrive late will be turned away. Please be on time to ensure a safe and secure container. \*\*

**Score Reasoning:** A one-day, spring-themed coven/ritual in a small healing studio—very Asheville-weird and great for connecting with others, but it’s low-scale/professional-local and organizers run many similar sessions so it isn’t highly rare.

| Asheville Weird      | 8/10      |
| Social / Meet People | 7/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** Recurring weekly-ish cat lounge session (so not rare) but charmingly niche — adult coloring + kitties earns an Asheville-weird +2 boost to uniqueness; small local venue, low regional draw.

**AI Summary:** Soothing, low-lit cat lounge session of gentle purring and cuddles alongside 50 minutes of adult coloring from provided books and markers; a social, stress-relief evening for cat-lovers seeking calm and creative connection.

<details>
<summary>Full Description</summary>

Feeling a little stressed out? Doom and gloom getting you down?

There are many scientific studies that support the understanding that petting cats and coloring relieves stress and anxiety. So why not do both?

Release your inner child by coloring with us in the cat lounge. Take 50 minutes for yourself and cuddle with the panthers, meet other cat-lovers, and color a beautiful picture of a cat from our adult coloring books!

Coloring books and markers (and of course, cats) are provided for this relaxation session. And once everyone is done with their picture, you can choose to take it home or hang it on the altar in the shop for Bastet!

Tickets are $15 per person and admission goes directly to the care of our resident panthers.

Children ages 12 and up are able to attend but it is meant to be calm and relaxing for all attendees so please keep that in mind. (We love kids but sometimes our stressors are our kids and we need time to ourselves!)

| Asheville Weird      | 8/10      |
| Social / Meet People | 8/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** Regular, likely recurring breathwork session (low missability) but high on novelty—ceremonial cacao + guided altered-state breathwork gives strong 'main character' energy and fits Asheville’s quirky wellness scene; small local venue with experienced facilitators (modest draw) and a strong community/sharing component for meeting people.

**AI Summary:** Uninterrupted rhythmic breathwork guiding an hour-long flow to access emotional release and altered states, led by experienced facilitators; session closes with ceremonial cacao and relaxed community sharing in a plant-forward bar setting.

<details>

| Asheville Weird      | 8/10      |
| Social / Meet People | 8/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** Weekly Asheville Movement Collective ecstatic-dance session so it's easily recurring (low rarity), but it's high-concept (guided sacred container/world beats) and very much an Asheville-style offering. Modest local draw (community venue rather than a major touring act), strong countercultural/ritual vibes, and opening circles/warmups make it highly social and good for connection.

**AI Summary:** Two morning ecstatic dance waves with DJ Kristikka weave world beats and rhythmic intensity into a guided inward journey, progressing from quiet embodiment through ecstatic release to meditative integration, with warmups and opening circles.

DJ \| Facilitator Kristikka

Intention: TBA

Kristikka (Kris Hostikka) loves creating a sacred container that takes you on an inward journey utilizing rhythm to move us from quiet embodiment to chaos and down into stillness and integration. She feels that movement is medicine, weaving intention and a rich blend of world beats where it’s possible to be with what is and open to what wants to be seen, felt and moved.

| Asheville Weird      | 8/10      |
| Social / Meet People | 6/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** A niche, recurring light-language sound-healing workshop at a small local studio — very Asheville-weird and high-concept but modest draw and fairly frequent, so good for connection but easy to miss only if you skip the series.

**AI Summary:** Exploratory vocal exercises and tonal sounds to activate individual light language, clear energy, and ease the nervous system; followed by a supine sound and energy healing integration to encourage somatic energetic flow.

<details>
<summary>Full Description</summary>

During our time we will explore vocal exercises and sounds to activate your light language. The vocal exercises are great for clearing and moving energy throughout your body, while easing your nervous system. This creates space to allow more energetic flow through your whole being.

Following this interactive session, you then will lay down and receive sound and energy healing to integrate your process. We all have the ability to access light language and if you have been called or intrigued, please reach out!

This is a non-judgement, safe container for free expression and play.

When: Sunday, March 8th
Time: 3:30 - 5pm
Sliding Scale: $25-40

**Lauren’s Bio:**

As a certified Reiki Master, Advanced IET Practitioner, and Munay‑Ki Shamanic Practitioner, I blend deep knowledge of energetic systems with intuitive guidance.

My journey into healing led me to train in sound healing, vocal therapy, Ayurveda, and natural medicines—all central to my transformative approach. For nearly a decade, I’ve been channeling light language, a vibrational transmission that transcends words to spark profound energetic shifts.

I hold private sessions and lead group gatherings, always cultivating a safe, nurturing environment where deep healing and self‑discovery can unfold. I believe true healing occurs when we reconnect with our essence, release what no longer serves us, and step into our highest potential.

My work supports this process—facilitating energetic realignment, spiritual awakening, and personal growth. My mission is to hold space for transformation, empowering each person to reclaim their inner light and walk a path of wholeness.

**Score Reasoning:** A local, free community fire + potluck is likely part of a recurring spiritual circle (hence low rarity) but offers a distinctive, high-concept ritual experience that feels very Asheville. It’s small-scale and hyper-local in draw, yet highly social and steeped in the city’s quirky/ceremonial vibe.

**AI Summary:** Nighttime outdoor fire circle with a guided sacred fire ritual and communal potluck where participants share homemade dishes, intention setting, songs, and quiet reflection for connection and renewal.

| Social / Meet People | 9/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** Low-missable local wellness meetup (similar sessions recur) so rarity is low; a niche, consent-forward platonic cuddle has high ‘main character’/unique energy (Asheville-weird bonus applied); small community-scale draw; very much fits Asheville’s quirky/progressive scene; and explicitly designed for connection, so strong social potential.

**AI Summary:** Warm, consent focused platonic touch afternoon for people who identify as female, non-binary, or trans masc; facilitated group and partner cuddles create an inclusive, nonsexual space, registration required online.

<details>
<summary>Full Description</summary>

[To register for this event click here.](https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/thursday-march-19th-abcd-anyone-but-cis-dude-platonic-cuddle)
Join us for an afternoon of warmth, connection, and platonic touch. This cuddle event is dedicated to celebrating the beauty of human connection and fostering a safe and inclusive space for individuals of all backgrounds who self identify as female, non-binary, or trans masc. Come as you are, and let's create a space where warmth, understanding, and connection thrive. Excluding cis men from this event is an way to create a space where some participants feel more at ease, allowing them to engage in cuddling without triggering past discomfort.

This is a non-sexual touch based event that invites participants to explore platonic intimacy with like-minded people in an environment that upholds personal boundaries and respect through a supportive framework of mutual agreements that maximize safety and create a space of easy openness and compassionate connection.
At this event we have the chance to normalize touch and intimacy with clear boundaries; this is a space for respectful, consent-based touch. We allow ourselves to be seen. We have fun. We get our touch needs met.

**THE RULES:**
1\. Clothes stay on for the whole event\.
2\. You do not have to touch anyone at this event\.
3\. You must ask permission and receive a verbal YES before you touch anyone\. Please be specific in your requests\.
4\. If you feel a yes\, say YES\. If you feel a no\, say NO\. If you’re a maybe\, say NO\. You can always change your mind\.
5\. Get your facilitator if you have a question or concern\, or if you need assistance with anything during the event\.
6\. Talking\, laughter\, silence\, silliness\, stillness\, and crying are welcome\.

**WHY CUDDLE?**
Touch is a basic human need, and many of us do not get enough; most people don’t even know they are missing touch, or have a way to ask for touch without sexualizing it. We believe deeply in the power of touch, and the importance of communication and consent in creating a safe space for touch.
CUDDLING WITH STRANGERS
Cuddling with strangers sounds weird or scary to most people. “Will I like it?” “What if someone wants to touch me and I don’t want to?” “What if I say yes and it’s not what I want?” “What if I really want to touch someone and they say no?” These are all normal questions. The answer is that this is a space created to ask for exactly what you want, and receive NOTHING you don’t want. Many people start out nervous at a cuddle event. Most are really, really glad they came.

**Schedule:**
Arrive with snacks to share! Get comfortable, meet, mingle, & snack.
Welcome Circle- its mandatory. We will set our container, talk about personal boundaries, communication, & consent.
Icebreakers and connective activities.
Open cuddling! You MUST ask and get a verbal ‘yes’ before touching or cuddling with anybody at this event. If you are not sure how to do this – great! – we will talk about...

**Score Reasoning:** Lotus is a national touring jam/electronic act playing a one-night stop at The Orange Peel (high rarity + regional draw). Psychedelic, improvisational dance sets give strong unique/main-character energy (Asheville-weird friendly), and the club setting + afterparty make it reasonably social.

**Score Reasoning:** Tour stop for experimental bass acts at intimate Third Room — a true one-off night with high-concept, bass-heavy programming (Asheville-weird bonus applies). Small-club draw (regional touring artists) with decent dance/mingle potential and VIP booths, making it unique and timely but not a stadium-level event.

**AI Summary:** Bass-heavy experimental electronic sets push subsonic low end and skittering percussion through an intimate club setting, as pheel and Chez headline a tour stop with Tunic, BK, and Ephygy—VIP booths available.

pheel., aka Philip Gallo, hails from the east coast and is currently residing in Denver. Since he moved in 2016, he has immersed himself in developing a unique perspective on bass music, drawing influences from a mixture of his roots as well as the local Colorado community, pheel. strives to take his audience on a sonic adventure with each set, guiding them through equal parts hip-hop and “bass music”. He pays respect to the classics of his youth simultaneously reimagining these tracks with modern production techniques and rumbling bass lines.

Chez:

HEAR SOME MUSIC: **https://chez4prez.bandcamp.com**

SEE A VIDEO: **https://youtu.be/8dN4Px182L8?si=F-b-cIsc7xUhKBLh**

Hailing from Chicago, Chez is the electronic bass music producer who’s here to prove that cheese isn’t just for charcuterie boards—it’s a lifestyle. Pronounced like the dairy delight but spelled like a French bistro, Chez is 100% mice-friendly and 110% people-approved. Chez exists in a contemporary space of music built on the shoulders of stylistic icons from the past. He would likely say, “it’s just fun”, an ideal that is core to the energy of the noise. With ease, he rallies lifelong music experience that delightfully coexists with novel production. Full of references to the boom bap greats, Chez focuses on bass-forward electronic beats primed for the dance floor. As a result, the sound is oddly familiar while routinely asserting itself into the new. Simply put, the Chez project is about playfulness and connection. It’s music for the head-nodders, the dancers, and for anyone who believes in doing what you love with the people you love. Come for the beats, stay for the good times and cherish the connections made along the way.

**Score Reasoning:** Limited multi-night run of a world-class contemporary circus at the Wortham Center — high-concept, theatrical and surreal (strong Main Character energy and regional draw), but a seated performance so low socializing.

**Score Reasoning:** One-night fundraiser cabaret—more special than a weekly show but not once-ever (rarity 7). High-concept drag celebrity-impersonator dinner with campy cabaret earns strong uniqueness (plus an Asheville-leaning bonus). Held at Highland Brewing’s event center—solid local draw (magnitude 5). Clearly queer-forward, theatrical, and fun for the city’s weird-vibe crowd (ashevilleWeird 7). Sit-down catered dinner and interactive performances make it a friendly social event for meeting people (social 7).

**AI Summary:** Legendary music icon impersonations delivered with sequins, campy humor, and cabaret flair, paired with a decadent Celine and Company catered dinner; 21+ brewery fundraiser supporting Beloved Asheville in an intimate event center.

**Score Reasoning:** One-night/special immersive fantasy musical with original songs and audience interaction at intimate Story Parlor — high-concept and distinctly artsy (hence high uniqueness and Asheville-weird), but a local, small-venue production so moderate magnitude and social potential.

**AI Summary:** Immersive fantasy musical where a hidden heir sparks a rebellion against an evil queen, told through original songs, sharp humor, and lively audience interaction that unfolds around the intimate Story Parlor stage.
