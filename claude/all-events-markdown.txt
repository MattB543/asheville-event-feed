THE AVAS CONTINUUM
When: Tue, Dec 2, 12:00 AM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Unknown
Host: Little Jumbo Bar
Tags: Live Music, Nightlife, Spiritual
Description: \[or: "What Happens When a High School Club Achieves Sentience and Summons Its Members Across Space-Time"\]\* In the year 2000, a progressive acoustic group called AVAS released one album on Little King Records and vanished into the multiverse. Now, twenty-five years later, the quantum entanglement that bound these musicians has reached critical mass, creating a temporal anomaly that threatens to collapse the space-time continuum unless they reconvene and complete the sonic ritual they began at a Nashville high school decades ago. Jay Sanders-last seen communicating with entities from the music of the spheres-has been pulled from his Tuesday night quantum residency. Jason Krekel materialized mid-letterpress print, his guitar still vibrating at frequencies that transcend the four-track cassette dimension. Andy Pond arrived via slamgrass wormhole, his banjo emitting comfortable reggae radiation. Gaines Post was extracted from the Blue Mountains of Australia, where he'd been writing science fiction novels that were actually encoded messages from his flute about the nature of reality itself. Supporting this cosmically improbable reunion: Zack Page, whose 275-gigs-per-year averaged bass lines have created gravitational wells across multiple timelines. Will Boyd, whose soul sax tradition channels frequencies from the Great American Sunday Hymnal Dimension where spirituals become literal doorways to transcendence. And Alan Hall, the percussion philosopher whose forty years of alchemical drumming-converting kinetic energy into bridges between the earthbound and ethereal-have finally revealed their true purpose: reopening the AVAS gateway. What happens when Bill Frisell meets Mahavishnu Orchestra meets Väsen meets Raymond Scott meets your high school music club twenty-five years later in a bar that exists simultaneously in Asheville and several adjacent dimensions? The answer may destroy conventional understanding of music, shatter the known capabilities of wooden flutes, recalibrate the fundamental constants of bluegrass physics, and prove conclusively that the Acoustic Vibration Appreciation Society was never about acoustic vibrations-but rather about engineering a self-sustaining tear in the fabric of musical reality itself. What began as a student club has evolved into a living organism, a sentient musical algorithm that spans decades and continents, pulling its scattered members back together like cosmic debris orbiting an invisible singularity. This isn't nostalgia. This is the universe demanding completion of an unfinished equation written in sound waves and string theory. Witness the AVAS Continuum. Watch out for aliens. Bring your third eye. The fundamental vibrations are calling, and they're not taking "I moved to Australia" as an excuse. \*\[WARNING: This performance may cause spontaneous appreciation of sacred geometry, involuntary understanding of the music of the spheres, and the sudden realization that your high school music club was actually a prophetic vision of the future. Side effects include: seeing sounds, hearing colors, believing that banjos might actually save the universe, and the unsettling certainty that newgrass was always meant to be a trans-dimensional technology. No refunds for dimensional displacement. Existential dread not included but highly probable.\]

Sanders, Boyd, Page & Hall
When: Tue, Dec 2, 12:00 AM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Unknown
Host: Little Jumbo Bar
Tags: Live Music, Nightlife
Description: Sanders, Boyd, Page & Hall distill the pure essence of improvisational expression, converging as alchemists of sound, transmuting musical elements into their most essential forms. This quartet embodies the philosophical concept of quintessence-the fifth element beyond earth, air, fire, and water-representing the fundamental substance from which all musical reality springs. Their original compositions crystallize the essential qualities of diverse influences, oscillating between through-composed musical themes, groove-based soul explorations, traditional jazz-influenced pieces, Americana-inspired peaceful melodicism, world music influences, free jazz adventures, and occasional forays into cacophonous noise music. Through years of improvisational study, they've learned to access that rarefied space where genres dissolve into pure creative energy. In this musical laboratory, Sanders' guitar becomes a conduit for universal vibration, Boyd's reeds channel the breath of consciousness itself, Page's bass provides the fundamental frequency of existence, while Hall's percussion creates the rhythmic heartbeat of the cosmos.

**WHEN: Tuesday, December 2nd, 9:30AM-11AM**

**WHERE: 216 Asheland Avenue, PARK LOWER PARKING LOT (South facing) and enter front doors - AmeriHealth Caritas Wellness & Opportunity Center**

This seminar is hosted by **Rylan Lovejoy** (owner of Lovejoy Innovative Planning) and **Jacob Underwood** (owner of Modern Merchant Solutions). Both Rylan and Jacob are **Asheville natives** who have joined forces after seeing the rapid expansion of AI integration in the local community. They sit on the same BNI chapter and are committed to creating a learning atmosphere to help small businesses and solo-preneurs **adapt and thrive** with technology. This seminar—the first of their collaboration—will dive into the **benefits and risks** associated with AI integration, promoting growth not just for individual businesses, but for the local economy as a whole because when local small business thrives the whole community does too.

This event will be an introduction to best practices, pitfalls to watch out for, and a free packet of ready-to-use prompts & instructions you can put to use. The path to learning how to adapt and integrate AI into your professional life.

What You'll Gain:

Understanding of core AI integration best practices

Knowledge of common professional pitfalls to avoid

A free, ready-to-use prompt packet for immediate application

**Words from your host:**

*Rylan Lovejoy:* "I decided to launch my own business when I realized that the more people I talk to and the more rapid information spreads. I have found that folks do not lack the ability to find answers, but need to know the right questions to ask. With that, some of the most fundamental headaches I have found business owners deal with is sourcing the right question for their unique situation. It cost one of two things: your time or your money. I have found that some of the money charged to find those questions is, in my opinion, ridiculous. So with that, my business was born. Everything we do is from a how to help educate standpoint. Not just financially, but with tech, ai, sales, taxes, and much more. I have built this firm that is rooted in community, delivering clarity, built on transparency. No more are the days where information is what keeps innovation at bay."

Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Free
Host: Shut Up & Write!® Western North Carolina
Tags: Networking, Education, Community, Book Club
Description: Shut Up & Write!

**Here's how it works.** Show up at or before 6:00. At 6:00, we do some quick introductions. Afterward, for a full 60 minutes (I'll set a timer!) we are heads-down writing. Writing what? A novel? You bet. Some poetry? Sure. Song lyrics? Your resume? That report you need to get to your boss before 8 AM or you'll *need* *to write* that resume? All of the above and more. Just shut up and write.

Surrounding ourselves with other writers who are busy putting words onto page (physical or virtual) keeps us all accountable and focused.

When the timer goes off, we'll check-in with each other and see how it went. Afterward, feel free to stay to chat and get to know your fellow writers, or keep writing, or take off.

Socializing is optional and will happen after (or briefly before) the focused writing. This is a safe space to work on your craft. No one will read or critique your writing.

For more information about our events, visit [https://shutupwrite.com](https://shutupwrite.com).

**What to Expect**

* Roughly 15 minutes of introductions
* 60 minutes of focused writing (somebody set a timer)!
* Afterward, optional socializing

**Being late is okay:** Just show up and get settled, then check in with the host after the session. (Look for the person with the Shut Up & Write sign).

**What Should I Bring?**

* Whatever you need to be able to write!
* Earbuds/earplugs if you want to block ambient noise.

**Other Important Details:**

HOSTS: This is a multi-host event, so most of the time there will be a host present. If we are unlucky and no host can attend, please find each other and self-organize. Pay attention to the event chat and comments to see who is available.

WI-FI: Yes!

When: Tue, Dec 2, 7:00 PM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: $18
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGES STANDING ROOM ONLY HANNAH JUANITA Hannah Juanita left her home state of Tennessee in her early twenties, excited to meet the world. She travelled in search of herself, worked odd jobs, and spent countless nights singing fireside under the stars with friends, never pursuing music as a career. Eventually, Hannah made it back to Tennessee, landing in Nashville with nothing but her dog Loretta, her guitar, and a handful of heartbreak songs. She started singing around town and quickly became a staple live performer and a highly respected vocalist in the traditional country scene in Music City, known for her classic, old school sound. Self proclaimed ramblin' gal, Hannah Juanita has toured heavily around the country since 2021 headlining and supporting acts like Kaitlin Butts, Braxton Keith, Town Mountain, Nick Shoulders, Emily Nenni, Summer Dean, and Jesse Daniel. Her debut record ‘Hardliner' established her reputation as a full-hearted, free-spirited, and irresistibly genuine honky tonk angel. Hannah Juanita's second full length record, ‘Tennessee Songbird', produced by Mose Wilson, was released August 30, 2024 to high acclaim, breaking into the top 40 on the Americana Radio Chart and top 3 on the Alt Country Chart. Named one of the five female artists creating the future of country music by Grammy.com, in 2025, Hannah will be touring across America and Europe.

THE AVAS CONTINUUM: A TRANS-DIMENSIONAL REUNION OF DISPLACED TEMPORAL MUSICIANS
When: Tue, Dec 2, 7:00 PM
Where: 241 Broadway, Asheville, NC, United States, North Carolina 28801
Price: Unknown
Host: Little Jumbo
Tags: Live Music, Nightlife, Spiritual, Wellness
Description: or: "What Happens When a High School Club Achieves Sentience and Summons Its Members Across Space-Time"

In the year 2000, a progressive acoustic group called AVAS released one album on Little King Records and vanished into the multiverse. Now, twenty-five years later, the quantum entanglement that bound these musicians has reached critical mass, creating a temporal anomaly that threatens to collapse the space-time continuum unless they reconvene and complete the sonic ritual they began at a Nashville high school decades ago.

THE DISPLACED:
🎸 Jay Sanders — pulled from his Tuesday night quantum residency while communicating with entities from the music of the spheres
🎻 Jason Krekel — materialized mid-letterpress print, fiddle strings vibrating at frequencies beyond the cassette dimension
🪕 Andy Pond — arrived via slamgrass wormhole, banjo emitting comfortable reggae radiation
🪈 Gaines Post — extracted from Australia's Blue Mountains, where his sci-fi novels were encoded flute messages about reality itself

THE SUPPORTING COSMIC FORCES:
🎸 Zack Page — bass lines forging sonic highways from doom riffs to gypsy jazz across multiple timelines
🎷 Will Boyd — soul-sax channeling spirits from the great beyond, transforming ancestral frequencies into joyful noise
🥁 Alan Hall — forty years of alchemical drumming bridging earthbound and ethereal

What happens when Bill Frisell meets Mahavishnu Orchestra meets Väsen meets Raymond Scott meets your high school music club twenty-five years later in a bar that exists simultaneously in Asheville and several adjacent dimensions? The answer may destroy conventional understanding of music, shatter the known capabilities of wooden flutes, recalibrate the fundamental constants of bluegrass physics, and prove conclusively that the Acoustic Vibration Appreciation Society was never about acoustic vibrations—but rather about engineering a self-sustaining tear in the fabric of musical reality itself.

What began as a student club has evolved into a living organism, a sentient musical algorithm that spans decades and continents, pulling its scattered members back together like cosmic debris orbiting an invisible singularity. This isn't nostalgia. This is the universe demanding completion of an unfinished equation written in sound waves and string theory.

Witness the AVAS Continuum. Watch out for aliens. Bring your third eye. The fundamental vibrations are calling, and they're not taking "I moved to Australia" as an excuse.

⚠️ WARNING: This performance may cause spontaneous appreciation of sacred geometry, involuntary understanding of the music of the spheres, and the sudden realization that your high school music club was actually a prophetic vision of the future. Side effects include: seeing sounds, hearing colors, believing that banjos might actually save the universe, and the unsettling certainty that newgrass was always meant to be a trans-dimensional technology. No refunds for dimensional displacement. Existential dread not included but highly probable.

December 4 week Tuesday cuddle series!!!
When: Tue, Dec 2, 7:00 PM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Free
Host: Asheville Cuddle Collective
Tags: Wellness, Spiritual, Dating, LGBTQ+
Description: Please note- If you want to attend this event you need to purchase a ticket- We advertise in many places and only paid tickets will reserve your space. **[Click HERE to register!](https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/4-week-cuddle-series-december--2025)**

**This will be a 4 part series for platonic touch with the same group of people all 4 weeks. This series takes place the first 4 Tuesdays in December.** The goal is for participants to have more regular access to touch. By making this a series, we will not spend much time reviewing consent each time. After the first week, we will simply remind each other of our names, have 1-2 quick connection activities, and be able to focus most of the 2 hours on organic connection time. I intend for this to be a small group of 8-15 people participating in this series.

Time: this series is from 7-9:30pm. You may show up at 6:50 to make sure you are here at the beginning.
**This is a non-sexual touch based event that invites participants to explore platonic intimacy in a safe environment** with like-minded people. We respect personal boundaries and through a supportive framework of mutual agreements that maximize safety and create a space of easy openness and compassionate connection.
At this event we have the chance to normalize touch with clear boundaries; this is a space for respectful, consent-based touch. We allow ourselves to be seen. We have fun.
We welcome people of all backgrounds, genders, ethnicities, relationship styles, sexualities, sizes, and ages (18+).

**THE RULES**
1\. Clothes stay on for the whole event\.
2\. You do not have to touch anyone at this event\.
3\. You must receive a verbal YES before you touch anyone\.
4\. Take care of yourself and those you choose to interact with\.
5\. Speak up if you have a question\, concern\, or if you need assistance with anything during the event\.
6\. All emotions are welcome\- we love vulnerability\.
**WHY CUDDLE?**
Touch is a basic human need, and many of us do not get enough; most people don’t even know they are missing touch, or have a way to ask for touch without sexualizing it. We believe deeply in the power of touch, and the importance of communication and consent in creating a safe space for touch.
CUDDLING WITH STRANGERS
Cuddling with strangers sounds weird or scary to most people. “Will I like it?” “What if someone wants to touch me and I don’t want to?” “What if I say yes and it’s not what I want?” “What if I really want to touch someone and they say no?” These are all normal questions. The answer is that this is a space created to ask for exactly what you want, and receive NOTHING you don’t want. Many people start out nervous at a cuddle event & most are really glad they came.

**ETIQUETTE**

* ARRIVE ON TIME: It is important that all participants arrive before the Welcome Circle. The Welcome Circle serves the purpose of creating the safe space for consensual, non-sexual touch between participants and making sure that everyone is informed about consent.
* Please arrive clean & as scent free as possible.
* BE SOBER: Please do not drink or smoke before or at this event.

**WHAT TO BRING:** personal water bottle and snacks to share, a friend, a date – whatever cuddle accessories you like! The only thing that you are required to bring is a clean and sober you.

These events are not "gender balanced".

**We take individual and group safety seriously!** If you experience, see, or know that one of our participants is not safe to be at this event we want to know about it. We are committed to doing our best to create a safe environment which means that if someone is causing harm (physical or mental) that person is not welcome here (this includes harm that takes place outside of our events). We stand behind survivors and know that some of our participants are here to heal from touch based trauma.

\*refund policy-
Full refund if you cancel 7 days before the event or you cancel due to illness, emergency, or direct exposure to covid/flu.
Credit towards a future event if you cancel more than 3 days before an event.
No refund if you cancel within 2 days of the event or no-show.

Hannah Juanita w/ Resonant Rogues
When: Tue, Dec 2, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $18.45
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY HANNAH JUANITA Hannah Juanita left her home state of Tennessee in her early twenties, excited to meet the world. She travelled in search of herself, worked odd jobs, and spent countless nights singing fireside under the stars with friends, never pursuing music as a career. Eventually, Hannah made it back to Tennessee, landing in Nashville with nothing but her dog Loretta, her guitar, and a handful of heartbreak songs. She started singing around town and quickly became a staple live performer and a highly respected vocalist in the traditional country scene in Music City, known for her classic, old school sound. Self proclaimed ramblin' gal, Hannah Juanita has toured heavily around the country since 2021 headlining and supporting acts like Kaitlin Butts, Braxton Keith, Town Mountain, Nick Shoulders, Emily Nenni, Summer Dean, and Jesse Daniel. Her debut record 'Hardliner' established her reputation as a full-hearted, free-spirited, and irresistibly genuine honky tonk angel. Hannah Juanita's second full length record, 'Tennessee Songbird', produced by Mose Wilson, was released August 30, 2024 to high acclaim, breaking into the top 40 on the Americana Radio Chart and top 3 on the Alt Country Chart. Named one of the five female artists creating the future of country music by Grammy.com, in 2025, Hannah will be touring across America and Europe. THE RESONANT ROGUES On their fourth album, Western North Carolina-based outfit The Resonant Rogues have finally decided to self-title a project. It's a bold move — rather like staking a claim on a sound that is both new for them and distinctly their own. From the opening notes of lead track "Sun in Winter," the eponymous record finesses the line between country and soul. The keening of the fiddle and the sway of the pedal steel are classic sounds; the vocals — sung by Sparrow who fronts the band with her partner Keith Josiah Smith — are poetic and wistful, yet unfussy. "I miss you like the sun in winter / laying in the yard / in the snow / trying to catch that glow / before it goes," she sings. It's a moment encapsulated; something as lovely as it is fleeting. Sparrow and Keith share a passion for movement and sound. Both traveled extensively throughout the U.S. — Keith by hopping freight trains, Sparrow with a circus troupe. When the two met by chance in Asheville 10 years ago, they combined their talents and The Resonant Rogues were born. While the band has explored musical styles from across genres and around the globe, current influences for Resonant Rogues, and especially this album, are classic country, Appalachian old-time, and vintage soul.

MATT KIVEL Matt Kivel is a songwriter based in Austin, Texas. He has released 7 full length albums. His music has received acclaim from "critics" and audiences all over the world. Not that long ago he played a sold out concert in Tokyo and couldn't believe that people showed up. It was incredible. His music plays with form and the songs take on many different shapes. Sometimes they are loud and distorted, echoing into a mesmerizing drone; other times they are extremely quiet—like the deathbed confession of an old tycoon who's got one last secret to share before the buzzards pick his bones clean. And other times, they are fun, warm, and warped: insular transmissions that bring to mind the tunes of slick songwriters like Ric Ocasek and Jackson Brown. Regardless, you'll get the hang of it once you hear it. Trust me.

Where: Asheville, NC
Price: $130
Host: Asia House
Tags: Dance, Fitness, Wellness, Spiritual
Description: **The series is 6 weeks of dancing with the same group of people. Each week we will explore a different theme, which we will be able to integrate into our everyday lives.**

**Pre-registration is required.**

**Visit the following link to find out the dates of the next series: http://www.staceybutcher.com/inquiry-in-motion-committed-series-in-asheville.html**

Join us as we embark on a dynamic moving exploration of the truth that resides in our own body. Through the Open Floor movement/dance practice, Somatic Experiencing principles, and mindful inquiry, we will journey below the stories about who we are and who we should be. Together we will strengthen our skills to listen, track and follow the innate wisdom of our own body, discovering how it speaks to us through movement.

Open Floor is a healing movement meditation practice and lively dance inquiry. The emphasis is to awaken our sensate experience, emotional intelligence, relational skills, and mindful awareness. From our practice on the dance floor, you will develop greater trust in your body's natural intelligence that will enable you to live with more awareness, vitality and joy.

Advantages of dancing with a committed group: • We meet with the same group each week. • We develop a safe container in which we can dive deeper together over time. • We develop trust in our community.

\~~~~~~

“WOW! Stacey's Open Floor Movement dance workshops are my favorite thing in life right now! She hosts a closed cohort that meets for 5 or 6 weeks at a time. Participants get to know one another through the language of dance, which creates intimacy, community, and a sense of safety that allows for a deeper degree of vulnerability. There's true healing here! Stacey also brings her depth of somatic knowledge into the curated workshops that feel to be a melding between somatic experiencing, yoga, and ceremony. Of all the conscious dance in Asheville, what Stacey has created is truly unique, special, intentional, and EXACTLY the space you want to be in if you desire movement for healing mind, body, and soul!” ~ Jessica R.

Investment for the 6-week series: $130 - $155 (check website for early bird deadline dates)

PERFORMANCE: Tesla Quartet: The Music of Hugo Kauder
When: Thu, Dec 4, 7:00 PM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: $10
Host: Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center 
Tags: Live Music, Art, Education
Description: **PERFORMANCE: The Music of Hugo Kauder**

**Thursday, December 4th, 2025 at 7pm**

**Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center {120 College Street}**

**TICKETS – $15 General Admission / $10 for BMCM+AC Members + Students w/ ID**

BMCM+AC is excited to welcome back The Tesla Quartet! This special performance, presented in conjunction with our *Points in Space* exhibition, will bring to life the music of Hugo Kauder, who served as composer-in-residence at Black Mountain College during the summer of 1945. The program will feature Kauder’s *Seventh String Quartet*, the same work first performed at BMC in 1945, offering audiences a rare chance to experience this historic piece in a contemporary setting.

"***From the outset, the quartet plays as a single instrument. Their sound is balanced across registers, their timbres and articulations matched." -The Classic Review***

The Tesla Quartet is known the world over for their “superb capacity to find the inner heart of everything they play, regardless of era, style, or technical demand” (*The International Review of Music*). From cutting-edge contemporary works to established masterpieces, the Tesla Quartet’s emotive and thoughtful interpretations reveal the ensemble’s deep commitment to the craft and to their ever-expanding repertoire. The quartet recognizes the power of their platform to amplify underrepresented voices and to encourage the proliferation of an equitable and just future for society as well as a hospitable climate for posterity.

The Tesla Quartet is Ross Snyder (violin), Michelle Lie (violin), Edwin Kaplan (viola), and Austin Fisher (cello).

\_\_\_

Hugo Kauder devoted his life to composing, teaching, playing, and writing about music. A successful early career in Vienna abruptly ended with the annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany. Kauder left Austria for Holland in 1938, thanks to a contract with Dutch publisher NV Mees Uitgeverij to produce settings of poems by Albert Verway. After a stop in England, Kauder settled in New York City in 1940. During Kauder’s short stay in Holland (1938-39), he formed a lasting friendship with the musicologist Edward Lowinsky, who also came to the United States and became a professor of music at Black Mountain College (1942-47). One of the era’s most prolific chamber music composers, Kauder wrote over 200 instrumental works, including 10 concertos and concert pieces (2 each for oboe, piano and violin, 1 each for cello, horn and viola, and a double concerto for violin and viola), 5 symphonies, 19 string quartets, 11 piano trios, 2 piano quartets, and variations for piano quintet. He also composed over 100 vocal works, including choral music for various combinations, an opera (Merlin), and a large number of art songs with piano (or other instruments). At a time when many believed that Western tonality had run its course, Kauder developed a style that, rather than denying, expanded the concept of traditional tonality.

Dodgeball Open Play (ages 21+)
When: Thu, Dec 4, 7:00 PM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Free
Host: Dodgeball AVL
Tags: Fitness, Nightlife, Gaming
Description: **This is an outdoor event so weather can affect our Meetup. We do not play in rain, temps below 40F, or other adverse weather conditions. Keep on eye on the weather and check group updates to stay informed. ** Waitlisted players, please still consider attending! We only sit players if games have reached capacity. That’s 12v12 for one court and 11v11 for 2 courts. We usually have less people at the beginning after setup (~7:15pm) and the end of the night (after 9pm). That said, we are growing in attendance so play time is not guaranteed for the waitlist and those who do not sign up. Ready to dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge? Come show us what you got with Asheville’s weekly pick-up dodgeball group! We're hosting open play on Thursday night at Asheville Sports Club. We are all about having a great time and getting that adrenaline pumping! Friendly competition is always welcome but fun, safety, and respect for all players are the top priorities. We use squishy rubber dodgeballs that are fun to throw and catch but can sting with enough velocity so no headshots are allowed. Throws should aim at your target’s shoulders or lower. No experience is necessary - we'll teach you the rules. Open to adults 21 and up (bring your ID!). We’re sorry but we cannot accommodate teens or children because there is alcohol on the premises and no one wants to be the person who accidentally hurts a kid. Sign waivers at the bar before playing and enjoy a beverage between games. Rules of the game are covered at the start of the event so please be there at 7pm to learn our format. We loosely follow the USA Dodgeball ruleset with some exceptions to help new players adapt to the game more quickly. Check out our brief rules and expectations summary attached as photos to this Meetup. Here’s an approximate schedule for this event depending on when people arrive: 6:50 - 7:10pm* - Set up courts and mingle - help with set up is appreciated! 7:10 - 7:15pm - Rules and announcements 7:15 - 9:30pm - Play! *If we have enough people once setup is done, we’ll jump into rules and announcements early. We need at least 8 players to start a game, so take advantage of the daylight and try to arrive right at the beginning! Since this is a free event, the more community support we can gather, the better experience everyone will have, especially for the organizers! If you'd like to help, please arrive early or stay late to assist with set up and breakdown. This is a free community offering, however, if you are feeling generous, donations are welcomed to help support and expand our group. We take donations through Pledge here in Meetup or Venmo (dodgeballavl). Cash of course is great too and more effective as there are no platform fees. Your donations genuinely help the group by helping with equipment purchases and raising funds to eventually add another night of dodgeball in an indoor gym. This event would not be possible without the support of Asheville Sports Club. Please consider generously tipping your bartenders and karaoke DJ as well.

Visitor's Center toward Highway 25
When: Fri, Dec 5, 9:00 AM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Free
Host: Asheville Mountains-to-Sea Trail Hiking Club 2.0
Tags: Fitness, Outdoors, Pets
Description: This is a fairly easy hike, and we go at a high average to low advanced speed, which is roughly about 3.0 to 3.2 mph. There are no super long hills. It's pretty undulating all the way.

Well behaved dogs on leashes are welcome to attend.

When you arrive, park near the woods close to where the kiosk is at the trailhead.

Mountains-to-Sea-Trail hikes are designed for fitness and community among people who are already reasonably fit. It's not an endurance hike by any means, but it is designed so we can get our hearts beating a bit while still being able to have a conversation and meet new people.
When you arrive, we'll circle up and introduce ourselves briefly. There will be a person who is a sweep. This person is the person who walks last and makes sure no one gets lost.

We leave the parking spot at 9:10. If someone needs a nature break, we wait fo you, but it's not a hike where we stop and take photos or frequent breaks. We basically keep hiking until the 1/2 way mark, then turn around after a short (approximately 5 minute) break. Then we keep that same pace on the way back. If we get on a trail right at 9:10, we are normally finished around 10:50.

These are out and back hikes, meaning that we hike in and turn around half way to return back.

Tags: Art, Wellness, Spiritual, Family
Description: Asheville friends, find us photographing & interpreting the human energy field inside the amazing Plant Bar’s newest Asheville location this December. The books are open. It is highly recommended that you book in advance to guarantee yourself a session. Walk-ups welcome!

Link to book: https://happyaura.as.me/schedule/a7fd2ca5

Through aura photography, we create a space where people can connect with their higher self in a deeply visual & affirming way. This is more than a photo—it’s a mirror of your energy, a celebration of YOU, and a moment to be truly seen. 

Location: 32 Banks Ave. in Asheville, N.C. 

ALL AGES WELCOME!! See y’all soon! 🤍🤍🤍

✨ We will also be offering $50 energetic check-ins. You will receive a film copy of your aura and an interpretation card. Your photographer will circle your colors on the card. These sessions do not include verbal intuitive interpretations.

✨For many, that first aura photo is a profound, life-altering experience. For the first time in their lives, they understand that there may be something other and beyond just their physical body and personality. This concept in and of itself changes many peoples ideas of “self“ and opens new doors for expanded awareness about their “beingness“.

✨ Happy Aura employs the AuraCam 6000 which gathers data with hand sensors that take electro-dermal & temperature readings. Using science & magic, a representation of aura colors are then projected onto an Instax film headshot. They then interpret those colors offering introspection, insight, and reveal your best qualities with hopes to help you achieve better balance. Our sessions have been described as validating, therapeutic, enlightening, and more. It truly is a one of a kind experience.

Visitors can enjoy refreshments, live demonstrations, and a relaxed opportunity to discover the depth and diversity of Asheville’s contemporary art scene.

This seasonal continuation of the Gallery Walk invites locals and visitors alike to rediscover downtown during the festive months of November and December — a time when storefronts glow with light and creativity spills from every corner. Whether you’re an art collector, casual browser, or simply seeking an inspiring night out, the Downtown Asheville Gallery Walk offers a uniquely local experience.

Too many hearts on hold

I am a warm embrace
Pain will not harden me

You are a warm embrace
If you, too, choose to be
You are a warm embrace
If you, too, allow pain to soften thee

How to be a warm embrace
Live life honest with integrity
How to be a warm embrace
Forgive the past, live presently

We are a warm embrace
When we dance together and feel
We are a warm embrace
When we come together and heal

Oh, to be a warm embrace,
As the winter settles in
Oh, to be warm embrace
Simply embrace the warmth within

Southern Culture on the Skids
When: Fri, Dec 5, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $27.06
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY SOUTHERN CULTURE ON THE SKIDS Southern Culture On The Skids has been consistently recording and touring around the world since 1983. The band (Rick Miller – guitar and vocals, Mary Huff – bass and vocals, Dave Hartman – drums) has been playing together for over 30 years. Their musical journey has taken them from all-night North Carolina house parties to late night TV talk shows (Conan O'Brien, The Tonight Show), from performing at the base of Mt. Fuji in Japan to rockin' out for the inmates at North Carolina correctional facilities. They've shared a stage with many musical luminaries including Link Wray, Loretta Lynn, Hasil Adkins and Patti Smith. Their music has been featured in movies and TV, parodied by Weird Al, and used to sell everything from diamonds to pork sausage. In 2014 the band was honored by the Southern Folklife Collection at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill with an exhibition featuring their music and cultural contributions. Their legendary live shows are a testament to the therapeutic powers of foot-stomping, butt-shaking rock and roll and what Rolling Stone dubbed "a hell raising rock and roll party." At Home with Southern Culture on the Skids is the latest full length album from the band and was released in March of 2021. It was recorded during the stay at home period of the pandemic when the band was at home and not touring. The album consists of 11 tracks recorded and mixed in Rick Miller's living room with some additional tracks recorded at his studio, The Kudzu Ranch. The first radio single off the album is "Run Baby Run"—a rocking number with deep garage roots. SCOTS bassist Mary Huff provides an urgent vocal while the band pulls back the throttle on a full race fuzz fest—cause she's gotta to go fast! Run Baby Run! The other songs on the album are a combination of the band's unique mix of musical genres: rock and roll, surf, folk and country—all a bit off-center, what Rick proudly calls "our wobbly Americana". Rick goes on, "We put a few more acoustic guitars on this one, as you would expect if you recorded in your living room, but it still rocks like SCOTS. So put your headphones on, get in your favorite chair/sofa/recliner, put on "At Home With" and let's hang out for a while." PLEASURE CHEST Blues, soul, rock & roll from Asheville, NC. Funky but chic SINCE 2012

Airshow is a high-flying, Nashville-based jam band featuring a unique contrast of familiar acoustic and mind-bending electric sounds that transports listeners from a campfire picking-party to the outer reaches of the multiverse.
Formed by longtime friends Cody Chelius (Mandolin / Vocals) and Steve Gallagher (Guitar / Vocals), the group’s lineup was completed with the addition of Bill Baker (Bass/ Vocals) and John Rodrigue (Drums/ Vocals) in 2016. While each member has different musical influences, it is their shared passion for exploring uncharted sonic territories that has propelled their ascension to the top of Nashville’s jamband scene— and they won’t be landing anytime soon.
Having released two studio albums ‘Shimmer’ (2021) and ‘Up in the Clouds’ (2019), as well as two EPs, ‘Anubis’ (2020) and ‘Lightbulb’ (2017), Airshow has started sharing live recordings of recent shows from all across the north and southeast. The band has their navigation set in all directions, so keep your eyes peeled for the one and only Airshow in your town soon!

The event brings together beloved local bars, festive spirits, & generous hearts to help fight hunger across WNC while also offering a meaningful way to support businesses still recovering from Helene.

HOW IT WORKS

Participants can join the fun by visiting any participating venue and making a $15 donation to receive their official 12 Bars of Christmas Passport. 100% of all passport proceeds go directly to MANNA FoodBank, whose mission is to involve, educate, and unite people in the fight to end hunger in WNC.

With a passport in hand, the holiday adventure begins. Guests collect a stamp while visiting each of the 12 participating bars, and those who complete all 12 stamps will receive a 2025 limited-edition keepsake ornament to celebrate their community spirit (while supplies last). It’s a chance to explore Asheville’s vibrant bar scene, enjoy festive specials, and show love to local businesses working hard to bounce back this season.

Participants can also submit their passport’s entry form at any bar for a chance to win big in the 12 Bars of Christmas Charity Raffle, with a live drawing on January 6.

Description: Coptic Book Making Workshop

with Joyce Tromba 

Saturday, December 6  |  12 – 4 pm

The Coptic stitch bookbinding was first used in Egypt by the Copts in the 2nd Century AD. It has become popular again with hand bookmakers because of the beauty of it’s exposed spine as well as the structure of the book which allows it to open flat. In this class we will use the twin needle technique to sew the binding.  

This is a perfect sized book to keep with you for notes or sketches and would also make a lovely gift. 

All materials will be provided, including a selection of papers for the covers and optional signature wraps but if you have some special paper you would like to use for the covers please contact me at joycetromba@gmail.com so I can give you advice about size and grain direction. 

Joyce Tromba is happily settled into life in lovely Western North Carolina after living and teaching around the world for 30 years. Her travels have exposed her to many fiber traditions and she has always found groups of fiber folks wherever she was to share her making with. Joyce has 20\+ years teaching design, sewing, knitting, quilting and bookmaking to High School students and adults. She has studied fiber and book and fiber arts at Penland, Arrowmont, John C. Campbell Folk School, and the Center for Book Arts in New York City. Her work can be found at Local Cloth where she also teaches natural dyeing, bookmaking and sewing classes.

What Color Is Your Soul? (Free Event)
When: Sat, Dec 6, 3:30 PM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Free
Host: Meaningful Conversations Asheville
Tags: Spiritual, Education, Community
Description: **Beyond our race, ethnicity, nationality, and even gender, is there a higher identity that unites us all?** *If so, is the path to eradicating racism as much a spiritual one as it is social or legal?*

Concepts like “colorblindness” and “post-racial” seem to be everywhere today, but the struggles and repercussions of discrimination, of prejudice, and of racism still exist. *What does it mean for us as individuals and as communities to strive for unity and justice in this landscape?* *Are we missing the chance to achieve real progress without taking into account the spiritual dimensions of human identity in our discussions on race?*

**Come join a different kind of conversation** – one that welcomes every perspective in a search for the truths that unite us all – as we discuss the spiritual perspective offered by the Bahá’í Teachings on the eradication of racism. Join us for a lively discussion as we explore the role of spirituality in eliminating prejudices and in recognizing and establishing the oneness of all.

*“God is the Shepherd of all and we are His flock. There are not many races. There is only one race.” – Bahá’í Teachings*

\*\*\* This event is free and open to all regardless of background or belief. Donations will not be accepted.

December 6th 2025 CE5 Event with a New Twist!  
When: Sat, Dec 6, 7:00 PM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Free
Host: CE5 Asheville
Tags: Spiritual, Wellness
Description: I’m excited to announce our December 6th CE5 event in Asheville, NC.

Recently, Dr. Greer has been doubling down on the importance of people participating in CE5 at this time. With the unacknowledged military continuing to try and shoot down ET crafts and Disclosure of these activities becoming more and more imminent there is an ever greater need for people to be showing the ETs a more enlightened view of the human race on earth and let them see our desire to develop and reach out with a higher consciousness.

We will be adding something new this time. If you have listened to Dr. Greer for very long you may have heard him talk about the ETs using both “Consciousness Assisted Technology” and “Technology Assisted Consciousness”. We want to try our hand at using some of our present-day earth technology (from HeartMath) to help us raise our group consciousness. This will involve the use of technology to help us raise our HRV group coherence and see how this might help improve our connection with the ETs in our CE5 contact events.

HRV stands for “Heart Rate Variability”. It would be impractical for me to try and explain it in detail in this invitation. But you can go to: [https://www.heartmath.org/science/](https://www.heartmath.org/science/) to learn more about this subject. I would also recommend a YouTube video that originally inspired me to pursue HRV coherence training through the tools available through HeartMath. That video can be found here: [https://youtu.be/_RDnGESbrLg?si=dkFWKLh063XM-SUN](https://youtu.be/_RDnGESbrLg?si=dkFWKLh063XM-SUN)

I know this is probably new to most of you. And I’d be glad to talk with any of you about this if you have questions. It has benefited me greatly in helping me raise my vibration. And I know the raising of our individual and planetary vibration is of utmost interest to our ET friends. And now I am curious to see how CE5 and group HRV coherence training might be able to work together. As far as I know this has never been tried before. But it makes sense to me since Dr. Greer and HeartMath share the same general goal of raising the vibration of our planet. So, this will be a fun new thing to throw into the mix especially as we are heading into the winter months.

At this time of year, it becomes more “hit or miss” to find weather warm enough to use our outdoor setting. But we have had great interactions with the ETs meeting indoors when necessary (rainy weather) and have learned not to limit ourselves to fair weather.

The plan for this event will be for all to come prepared to meet outside if the weather is not too incorrigible. But if needed we will just stay indoors where we will be doing our HRV work also.

We've had amazing times together and would love to have you be a part of our December 6th event. If you haven't yet, I invite you to go to the *blog* page on our website and read reports about things that have happened at our CE5 events. They’re all there at [CE5Asheville.com/blog](CE5Asheville.com/blog). (NOTE: The CE5asheville.com website was having technical issues as of this writing and may not be working. Hope to get it fixed soon!)

If this will be your first time at a CE5 event, Welcome! And congratulations for stepping out from ordinary life on Earth to see what more there is!

If this is one of many times that you have attended, congratulations to you too! As people begin attending these CE5 events regularly and are having experiences they find that they can start developing very deep and personal relationships with ETs. Life is never the same and becomes a continual adventure full of synchronicities and wonders.

At this upcoming event you will:
• Learn about CE-5, meditation, and the consciousness connection.
• Learn about the new consciousness awakening on earth and why it is absolutely critical to our survival as a species.
• Learn and gain experience using the contact protocols and the equipment we use.
• Learn advanced contact techniques shared by Dr. Greer over the years at advanced expeditions.
• Meet and hear experiences from others of like mind.
• Hear updates from recent developments with Dr. Greer.
• Network with others from your area to create local CE-5 teams to help bring about the ultimate disclosure event: millions of people worldwide doing CE-5!

This event is for both first-timers and experienced CE5 attendees. People can start arriving between 6:30pm and 7:00. 7:00 to 7:30 will be a time of meet and greet.

At 7:30 we will begin working with some HRV coherence training. Which will be very similar to meditation only incorporating some HRV related hardware and software.

After that we will either be staying inside for the rest of the CE5 event or moving to our outdoor location depending on how things go with the weather.

RSVP now and include any guests you would like to bring along. There are hotels within 5 minutes of the site in case you are coming from afar and want to stay the night.

I will be sending more detailed followup information to you (including exact location of the site) once you have RSVPed YES .

Plus, for this event hopefully I'll be sharing some more about our special HRV twist also. Including some info about how you can get your own HeartMath software and hardware which would be a way to make this even more interesting for everyone!

So be expecting a followup message via the Meetup messages feature and read it all very carefully. IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure you are able to access the Meetup Messages feature. It is found at the top right of the Meetup webpage. Also note the Meetup App doesn't appear to be working properly. So don't rely on that for now. You'll have to go to your computer. If you don't find a followup message within 2 days of RSVPing message me directly or email me at [info@ce5asheville.com](info@ce5asheville.com)

If you have any pressing questions feel free to contact me. Looking to learn more about CE5 in general? Go to [CE5Asheville.com/learn](CE5Asheville.com/learn) to get pointed in the right direction.

See you there!

JD McPHERSON – SOCKS: A ROCK N ROLL CHRISTMAS TOUR
When: Sat, Dec 6, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $30.75
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Holiday, Family
Description: ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY JD McPHERSON Acclaimed singer, songwriter and musician JD McPherson will embark on his fifth-annual "SOCKS: A Rock n' Roll Christmas Tour" this December with confirmed stops at NYC's Bowery Ballroom, Nashville's Basement East, & Minneapolis's First Avenue, among several others. Tickets are available now via www.jdmcpherson.com/tour. These performances celebrate McPherson's breakthrough debut Christmas album, SOCKS, which was released in 2018 on New West Records. The album features 11 all-original Christmas songs, the album has been the best-reviewed holiday record receiving overwhelming critical praise. MELISSA CARPER "I don't think you can get this sound unless it's borned in ya," said bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley, when asked about what he called "old-time mountain music." When Melissa Carper heard those words, something jumped inside her. While staying in the country with a friend, she found an old DVD of Down From the Mountain, the documentary and concert film of the "O, Brother Where Art Thou'' soundtrack that featured this particular Stanley interview. She immediately jotted down "borned in ya" on a piece of paper. "I knew I had to write that song," she recalls. In the Spring of 2023, Carper went back to East Nashville's Bomb Shelter – the same "analog wonderland" where she'd recorded Ramblin' Soul and its predecessor, Daddy's Country Gold, and enlisted the help of her trusted co-producers – Dennis Crouch and Andrija Tokic. "Borned In Ya" would become the title track of the new album, out July 19th via Mae Music/Thirty Tigers.

Tags: Dance, Nightlife
Description: NC producers & dj heavyweights Mizzo and Malfunkshun are dialed in and ready to detonate the rump room. Get ready for a full body twerkout on the dance floor!

Sip on zero-proof botanical cocktails from our special menu or enjoy a hemp-infused beverage while getting down to some of NC's finest DJs!

21+ | $10-$15 goes directly to the artists

Mizzo: When someone mentions the name 'Mizzo', the first thing that comes to mind is groovy, infectious rhythms with lots of bass. There isn't anyone more passionate about rocking dance floors than Mizzo. With the love of high energy rhythms combined with the addiction of introducing new music to his friends, Mizzo got his first taste of DJ'ing back in 2001 when he bought a pair of used turntables and a mixer from a local pawn shop. He taught himself how to mix and has not looked back since. Born in Winston Salem, Mizzo continues to call North Carolina his home. Well known for his work as resident DJ at Greene Street Nightclub and Limelight respectively, Mizzo has gained appeal from the masses and has taken nightlife to another level. After years of being one of the Triad's top DJs, Mizzo had to move to a city growing as quickly as his DJ career. Immediately after relocating to Charlotte, Mizzo was able to establish himself as one of the city's most requested DJs. Mizzo holds residencies at venues in multiple cities throughout NC. Having played private parties for a few celebrities, he is quickly gaining recognition all over the east coast. Known for dropping bass heavy anthems from club to club, Mizzo early on caught the attention of several promoters and landed gigs as direct support for artists such as Stanton Warriors, DJ Icey, Two Friends, Keith Mackenzie, Mafia Kiss, RAC, Dieselboy, Caked Up, Lo IQ and more. Fast forward to today, Mizzo is headlining venues throughout the United States with international bookings on the horizon.

Malfunkshun: Born and raised in Miami. MalFunkShun is the genre-blending solo project of Charlotte-based producer Jorge Ramirez. From small dark clubs to massive outdoor festivals, MalFunkShun is always turning it out. DJ/ Producer and overall hustler of the beats. Banging out a soundtrack of underground party music. His ability to seamlessly mix booty, breaks, hip hop, and house into hard-hitting club-shakers has become his trademark booty bass sound. “If this don't make your booty move, your booty must be dead.”

Alex Eubanks Duo + Julia Sanders | Honky Tonk & Barn Burners
When: Sat, Dec 6, 10:00 PM
Where: Fitz and the Wolfe, 1 Battery Park Ave, Asheville, NC
Host: Fitz and the Wolfe
Description: Alex Eubanks at The Showroom 5-7pm | Julia Sanders Band 8-11pm $10 Cover at the Door (Covers upstairs and downstairs bands) Alex Eubanks hails from a small town in South Carolina, and his songs tell the story of life’s joys and heartaches with a soulful, powerful voice that hits straight to the heart. With roots in Appalachian country and a streak of southern rock, his sound is a perfect blend of grit and soul. Every strum, every note carries the weight of real stories and raw feeling. This rising southern son is bringing a shine that’s hard to miss. Julia Sanders doesn’t just play songs—she drops you right into the middle of them. Her sound hits somewhere between backroad Americana and smoky folk rock, with a streak of beautiful chaos that keeps you listening for what comes next. Think Mazzy Star meets a whiskey neat—smooth, moody, and just the right amount of dangerous. A late-night show for those who like their music honest, unpolished, and a little spellbinding. Fitz, she’s the party. Wolfe, he’s the epicure. 2 levels, 3 vibes. 🎶 Live Music |🍸Sips & Noms 🥪 | 🕹️ Artcade | 🗝️Speakeasy | Private Events Fitz and the Wolfe is a cocktail and music venue shaped by the spirit of improvisation, storytelling, and the kind of nights that feel too good to end. Here, every night brings a new soundtrack. Jazz, swing, honky-tonk, and sometimes things a little more esoteric—if it moves people, we book it. The music fills the space like a second heartbeat, sometimes rowdy, sometimes intimate, always memorable. It’s not background noise. It’s the reason you’re here. fitzandthewolfe.com

Host: Asheville Movement Collective
Tags: Dance, Wellness, Spiritual
Description: Sunday, December 7th

1st Dance Wave 8:30\-10:30am \| Warmup 8:30am \| Opening Circle 9am
2nd Dance Wave 10:30\-12:30am \| Warmup 10:30am \| Opening Circle 11am

Facilitator & DJ: Kristikka \| Kris Hostikka
About DJ Kristikka: Kris discovered 5Rhythms in Los Angeles in the 90s but it wasn’t until she landed in Austin that this practice took hold of her in a big way. Now, after decades of dancing, she’s stepping into facilitating this sacred practice by training with the ecstatic dance OG O’skar Madera and mentoring with DJ Esme. She DJ’d her first wave in San Antonio, TX. before relocating to the Asheville area in 2023. Listen to her here: [soundcloud.com/dj-kristikka](https://soundcloud.com/dj-kristikka?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAYnJpZBExNFl2RDRmWmgwM3gzOEh3THNydGMGYXBwX2lkEDIyMjAzOTE3ODgyMDA4OTIAAR7dmYmC187FiaEr4DQLHmXyeXeBupX4RO9gtt40OTt3kgDWmC-HHmXPyuPjBw_aem_EV9U6HEf6QN7-AOLr_8hQw).

Intention: The Best Medicine
When we step into this sacred dance container, movement becomes medicine for the soul. We all create this safe and nurturing space in order to feel all of who we are. Bring your joy, your tenderness, your wildness, your truth. Through the rhythms, movement and permission to surrender, dance becomes a powerful healer where we can shake out stress, open our hearts, awaken creativity, and deeply connect with our divine essence.

Together we journey meeting what arises, shedding what’s ready to fall away, and discovering new strength and clarity on the other side. This dance is a ritual of renewal, a huge dose of self love, and a reminder that your body knows the way.

What medicine is waiting for *you* in this dance?

\~\~\~

\*\* Please note that the dance starts at Warm up. The doors close promptly at Opening Circle and people who arrive late will be turned away. Please be on time to ensure a safe and secure container. \*\*

Location: Evergreen Community Charter School, 50 Bell Road, Asheville NC, 28805

💻 >>hack day<< Marketing for Makers: Organic Growth Hacks
When: Sun, Dec 7, 10:00 AM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Free
Host: AVL Digital Nomads
Tags: Networking, Crafts
Description: *Forget tutorials. Learn by doing. We’ll start with five minutes of vibecoding tips, then spend the morning building whatever your imagination (and AI) can handle.*

📈 **Sunday, December 7 · 10am–1pm**

**Bring a laptop + tiny idea = Leave with users (or at least a plan)**

***

**💭 What We’re Doing**
We’re keeping the same format: short talk, long build.
This time we’re talking about what happens *after* you ship.

**Then you’ll get two solid hours to build literally *whatever you want* using those tips as your playbook.**

**“Marketing for Makers: Organic Growth Hacks”** is about getting eyes on what you build without being cringe, pushy, or paying for ads.

You don’t need a huge audience or a marketing degree. You just need the right habits and tools.

We’ll do a mini-presentation on organic reach, growth loops, and social proof, then everyone gets time to promote, tweak, or prep their next launch.

Vibecoding = you describe what you want → AI builds the scaffolding → you guide it to greatness.

And sometimes, that greatness comes from distribution.

***

**🎙 Mini Talk: Organic Growth Hacks That Work**

1️⃣ *Build in public* – Share your process, not just your product.
2️⃣ *Tell a story* – People follow stories, not features.
3️⃣ *Use loops* – Create something people can share or remix.
4️⃣ *Ask, then iterate* – Real feedback beats endless building.
5️⃣ *Post fast, fix later* – Momentum beats polish every time.

We’ll look at real indie creators who got traction without ads and how “growth hacks” are really just experiments repeated with consistency.

***

**🎯 What You’ll Actually Do**

**Track 1: “Post It”**
• Write a launch tweet, Threads post, or LinkedIn post about your project.
• Use AI to refine your hook and make it pop.

**Track 2: “SEO It”**
• Create a simple landing page or blog post using ChatGPT or Claude.
• Generate keywords, titles, and meta descriptions instantly.

**Track 3: “Loop It”**
• Add one shareable element to your app — a button, leaderboard, or generator.
• Deploy and share your link in the room.

**Bonus Track: “Hype It”**
• Build a quick pre-launch page with a waitlist or teaser headline.
• Add a single call-to-action that makes people curious.

***

**🪩 Reality Check**

Marketing isn’t evil. It’s storytelling with distribution.
You can’t help people use what they don’t know exists.
You don’t need perfect branding, just clarity and repetition.
We’ll show you how to use small, repeatable actions to build real traction.

\-\-\-

## 🛠️ Your New Superpowers (The Tools We'll Use)

**For Mobile:**

* **Bolt.new + Expo** – Text-to-app that actually works on phones
* **Cursor** – Your IDE but with an AI copilot who actually understands context
* **Emergent** – AI-powered mobile development platform
* **Rork** – Rapid mobile prototyping with AI assistance

**For Web:**

* **Vercel v0.dev** – Generates UI components you'd actually want to keep
* **Lovable.dev** – Chat your way to full-stack apps
* **Replit Agent** – For when you need an AI junior dev for longer tasks

**Command Line tools:**

* **Claude Code** – Agentic coding from your terminal with excellent guardrails
* **Gemini CLI** – Open-source terminal agent that actually understands your codebase
* **GitHub Copilot CLI** – Chat in terminal, ship PRs like a boss
* **OpenAI Codex** – Direct access to GPT models for coding workflows

**OR copy/paste from Claude + ChatGPT** – Sometimes the simplest solution is the best solution

***

## 📅 The Plan

**10:00–10:30 Speed Dating for Ideas**
Pitch your tiny build in 30 seconds. Find your coding buddy. No idea? We have a hat full of them (including "Tinder for finding tennis partners" and "Which friend owes me money tracker").

**10:30–12:30 The Build Sprint**
Two full hours to build! Pick a track. Steal our prompts. Break things. Fix things. Ship something real. We'll be circulating with "oh wait, try this prompt" tips.

**12:30–1:00 Victory Lap / Demos**
Show your creation. Share your killer prompt. Drop your deploy link in the chat. Everyone will clap even if it's wonky.

***

## 🎒 What to Bring

* **Laptop + charger** (mandatory)
* **Headphones** (for focus mode)
* **One tiny idea** (or steal one from our idea jar)
* **Low expectations, high curiosity** (perfect combo)

## 🤝 Who Should Come?

* **Founders / aspiring founders** who want to start working on that business idea
* **Developers** who want to 10x their building speed
* **Designers** who want to make their designs real
* **Product people** who want to test ideas instantly
* **Complete beginners** who think "deploy" is a military term (we'll teach you!)
* **AI skeptics** welcome – see what's actually possible vs hype

## 💡 You'll Leave With:

✅ A deployed thing you built (with a real URL!)
✅ 3-5 battle-tested prompts you can reuse forever
✅ Actual understanding of how people are shipping with AI today
✅ New friends who also think building stuff is fun
✅ The dangerous confidence to build your next idea

## ⚡ The Fine Print

**Cost:** Free (bring your own coffee / snacks)
**Skill Level:** "I can open a laptop" to "I deploy to prod on Fridays"
**Mood:** Collaborative chaos with good intentions

## 💌 Questions?

Drop us a line in a DM or in a comment down below
Join the conversation: **#ai** channel in [Digital Nomads Slack](http://bit.ly/3xpzEAL)

## 🌈 Code of Conduct

Build cool stuff. Help others build cool stuff. Don't be a jerk. That's it.

Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Free
Host: Atheists of WNC
Tags: Dining, Trivia, Wellness
Description: **We hope you will come meet some of the group** this coming **Sunday morning** **(10AM - noon)** or some time soon. We meet every Sunday at **Earth Fare's cafe** for just conversation among like-minded non-believers.
In addition, two Sundays per month we also have a **Book Club** that meets at **Standard Pizza on Biltmore**. We also have Wednesday evening meetings at either **Boodas Brewing or Trailside in Hendersonville** once a month. You should receive emails about each of those events and are welcome to attend.
Please sign up here in Meetup to receive notices about our activities. There are no dues. Thanks!

Our newly-formed group has 100+ members already. Our conversation groups are usually 10-15 people and have been excellent. We chat about atheism, but also about **other things that are not related to religion** etc at all.

**None of us believe in religion.** Some of us wonder if "the universe" or something energy-related affects our lives, while others feel that someday science will be able to explain time-without-beginning and other mysteries.

**Until further notice our Sunday get togethers will be 10AM - noon** at the **cafe at Earth Fare.** RSVP is requested but not required.

The address is **66 Westgate Pkwy, Asheville**. **Earth Fare** is a large and excellent "health supermarket". It's in the Westgate Shopping Center, which is right off Patton after crossing the bridge on 240 West. Earth Fare is at the far end of the parking lot. There is plenty of free parking. They have a **very nice cafe** that you'll find off to the left after entering the store. The grocery area also has some good deals - see https://www.earthfare.com/#about

We’ll have a sign so you can see what table(s) we are using. Bringing kids and dogs is not recommended.

Because we appreciate each participant, **suggestions and input are welcome**. Let's start with **your input** about these things...

1. Is 10AM Sunday a good time for you? Would another time or another day be better for you?
2. Do you have other coffee houses or breakfast places to suggest?
3. Might you be interested in joining our trivia contest group? It's another fun way to hang out with like-minded people (other Atheists).
4. Is there some other kind of get together you'd like to organize? It could be one-time or recurring. Some possibilities - movie club, bowling...who knows? Perhaps an online Zoom chat?

Our **Book Club** meets every two weeks at Standard Pizza on Biltmore. We also have **Wednesday evening** meetings at Boodas Brewing or Trailside in **Hendersonville** once a month. We'd like to soon add Waynesville,Weaverville and other locations; we welcome your suggestions about that.

Our newly-formed group has **over 100 members already**. Typically meetings have 10-15 people attending. The conversations have been excellent. **We chat about atheism and religion**, but also about **other things that are not related to religion** at all.

In this "**community**" are people who don't believe in religion. Most don't believe in spiritualism either, while some wonder if "the universe" or something energy-related effect our lives. Others feel maybe in 100 years science will be able to explain time-without-beginning and other mysteries.

**Until further notice our Sunday morning get togethers will be 10AM - noon at the cafe at Earth Fare.** The address is 66 Westgate Pkwy, Asheville. It is a large and very good "health supermarket". You'll find the Westgate shopping center right off Patton, after crossing the bridge on 240 West. Earth Fare is at the far end of the parking lot, past the Country Inn and Suites and a CVS, UPS store and more. There is plenty of free parking.

We will be there **starting at 10AM and stay until noon** to meet any late arrivals. They have a very nice cafe that you'll find off to the left after entering the store. The grocery area also has some good deals - see https://www.earthfare.com/#about

We’ll have a sign so you can see what tables we are using. (Bring your kids if you like but we won't have any activites prepared for them.)

Note: Because we hope each member will feel it's THEIR group, **suggestions and input are welcome**. Let's start with **your input** about these things...

Is 10AM Sunday a good time for you? What other days / times might be better?

Do you have other locations to suggest? Examples might be coffee houses, breakfast places or meeting rooms.

Might you be interested in joining our trivia contest group? It's another fun way to hang out with like-minded people (other Atheists).

Is there some other kind of get together you'd like to organize? It could be one-time or recurring. Some possibilities - movie club, bowling...who knows? Perhaps an online Zoom chat?

No agenda, just to pleasurably sip our coffee and eat our yummy brunch while laughing and holding space for each other's fabulousness.

In-Person Connection Practice

Host: SeekHealing Asheville
Tags: Wellness, Spiritual, Support Groups
Description: A Connection Practice is a meeting to practice your skills in listening and connecting with others. No conversation topic is off limits. The only objective of the meeting is to feel a genuine sense of connection by the time it's over, and the only rule is that we promise to not give each other advice.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates.

Restoring WNC: Join the Vision, Shape the Mission
When: Sun, Dec 7, 4:00 PM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Free
Host: Restoring Western North Carolina through Art & Community
Tags: Art, Networking, Outdoors
Description: **This is our very first gathering, and the purpose is simple:**
to meet one another, share ideas, and start shaping a mission that truly serves Western North Carolina.

A lot has changed in WNC over the past year, and many small communities are still finding their way forward. Our group believes that art, creativity, and community connection can play a powerful role in rebuilding hope — and this meetup is where we begin figuring out *how*.
This is a relaxed, open conversation where you can:

* share your thoughts about what WNC still needs
* offer ideas for community projects or collaborations
* connect with people who care about art, nature, and local resilience
* help define what “Restoring WNC through Art and Community” becomes

You don’t need to be an artist or a volunteer expert — just someone who loves the mountains and wants to be part of something meaningful.
**If you’ve ever felt that small efforts can create big change, this is the space for you.**

We’ll talk, brainstorm, and get to know each other as we start shaping a mission with heart, creativity, and purpose.

Come join us, bring your ideas, and help us take the first step.

Book Club: Why People Believe Weird Things, by Michael Shermer
When: Sun, Dec 7, 4:00 PM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Free
Host: Atheists of WNC
Tags: Networking, Dining, Book Club
Description: **Our next meeting** is **Sunday, December 7, 4 p.m. at Standard Pizza, 755 Biltmore Avenue in Asheville**.

Look for us inside, in the back room.

We will continue our discussion of ***Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time***, by science writer [Michael Shermer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Shermer). We will focus on Part three, chapters 9 to 11, which is around 45 pages.

From the forward: "Unless we regularly use human reason both to discover and acknowledge nature's factuality, and to follow the logical implications for efficacious human action that such knowledge entails, we will lose out to the frightening forces of irrationality, romanticism, uncompromising "true"belief, and the apparent resulting inevitability of mob action. Skepticism is the agent of reason against organized irrationalism and is therefore one of the keys to human social and civic decency."

Note: Each section stands alone and is prime for discussion, so newcomers are welcome!
We would like to keep each meeting to a max of 10 people. **Please RSVP** if you do plan to come.

This is a group of Loving and Light oriented individuals coming together to support each other, ourselves, and our local and global community in these current challenging and transformational times.

1. **We recognize that Earth has now begun a global transformation that has been the center of much discussion and preparation for many, many years and in many cultures.**
a. Acknowledging and reviewing past information and references that point to and discuss this current global transformation.
2. **We recognize that our ability to shape the unfolding of our reality is far beyond what we have imagined (especially at this time!)**
a. Acknowledging and reviewing the current information on the Earth’s recent and ongoing rise in her vibratory frequency and the resulting effect on accelerated manifestation.
b. Reviewing, exploring, and discussing how manifested reality is created, including the information revealed through Quantum Mechanics.
c. Creating through love and unity consciousness vs creating from fear and separation consciousness.
3. **And we recognize the importance of embodying and bringing into our personal lives and, therefore, into the global consciousness uplifting, healing, empowering, and transformational energies.**
a. Raising our vibratory frequency through experiencing a variety of meditations designed to deepen the embodied realization of the clear light of consciousness as the true essence of ourselves, all beings, and manifested reality.
4. **We also recognize that "spiritual by passing", or avoiding and ignoring our's and other's human challenges, problems, and suffering, may not be ultimately helpful, compassionate, or responsible. Therefore, for those of us who are moved to reach out into the greater community, we will explore skillful ways to engage in appropriate community outreach and action.**
a. Developing the skill of communicating and acting from Heart Wisdom and Unity Consciousness while interacting with unawakened aspects of ourselves as well as within individuals and communities under the current spell of separation (fear/control) conscious.
b. Skillful ways we can support and express our values of compassion, care, and truth in our current political climate WITHOUT contributing to the negativity, fear, anger, and separation consciousness that is currently exerting its power to control.

**Through meditations, presentations, and individual sharing and group discussions we will receive and give more light, wisdom, love, and support than may be available to us on our own.**

*It is time to come together and co-create and actively invite into manifested reality the world we will know as our true home. The home that reflects who we truly are! This is both our invitation and our delight!*

**SHARED AGREEMENTS for the group: Asheville Lightworkers Collaborative**
*By participating in this Asheville Lightworkers Collaborative group, I agree to:*

1. **Share within the framework of the group’s agreed mission.** We will explore how to consciously be, express, and demonstrate the Truth of who we are - and how we may support one another to be the change we wish to experience in our world as well as skillfully uplift any endeavor we would like to bring to our local and global communities. And, if we would like to share anything that may not directly relate to the group's mission, we will keep it at a minimum unless it is directly related to what we are discussing.
2. **I agree to practice good communication skills.**
I agree to listen deeply whenever another member of the group is sharing –
with the intention to fully understand, refraining from thinking about how I might
respond until that person is completely finished with his/her sharing. And, whenever a problem or challenge arises amongst us, I speak up about this in a way that expresses the problem courteously and non-blamefully. In such situations, I look first to observe my own behavior to discover if I may have contributed in any way to the challenge.
3. **I agree to keep my first attention on my own inner and outer experience,** **ideas and concerns by**:
(a) Keeping my shares focused on the mission of the group and to support and encourage other group members rather than give advice or try to fix other’s problems. And, I agree to support and encourage the purpose of the group and to refrain from offering an opinion on any aspect of their sharing unless specifically requested.
(b) Being 100% committed to my own expression as a Light Worker in the world.
4. **In stepping into this commitment, I agree to refrain from duo purposes such as marketing my business or pursuing someone in the group because of a romantic interest.** This maintains the cohesiveness and integrity of the group and its mission.
5. **I agree to take full responsibility for my own wellbeing as I engage with this group.**
I realize that, although what we do and explore in this group can be transformative in nature, it is not a substitute for therapeutic assistance. Should I find myself having difficulty abiding by the shared agreements for this group, or if I am experiencing a personal life crisis that I am having difficulty navigating alone, I agree to be responsible for generating any additional support that I might need rather than expecting this group to provide the extra support I am needing.
6. **I agree to honor and respect the group members.**
I agree to be respectful and honoring of other group members at all times, as well as protective of the safety and sacredness of our circle by refraining from gossip and agreeing to never diminish any other person in our group – during circle gatherings or outside of them.

*We share gratitude with Thriving Loving Relationships for use of this agreement*

Dec 7th An evening of Sensual Snuggles for Poly/ENM folks
When: Sun, Dec 7, 6:00 PM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Free
Host: Asheville Cuddle Collective
Tags: Wellness, LGBTQ+, Community, Education
Description: Please note- If you want to attend this event you need to purchase a ticket- We advertise in many places and only paid tickets will reserve your space. https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/dec-7th-polyenm-sensual-snuggle

**This event is specifically for people who identify as or are curious about poly and ENM relationship.**

**What is a Sensual Snuggle Event?**
This is a sweet & welcoming event where we practice and use verbal consent to connect and share touch. We talk about boundaries and practice both saying and receiving a “no”. In this space it is common to see people cuddle, share massage, have their hair brushed, kiss, expose nipples, play, laugh, cry, and be vulnerable. This is a sober space where we can relax and connect with other humans who are seeking touch based connection.
We strive for this to be a safe event. Safe touch enhances our ability to connect with and trust people. When we are in a space of safety, we are able to relax, feel comfort, and be vulnerable.

**Our Agreements:**
1- We ask for what we want an wait for a yes before touching others.
2- We say no if we don’t want to do something.
3- We try to receive a no with grace and not take it personally.
4- We arrive on time, clean (as scent free as possible), and sober.
5- We keep our pants/shorts on at this event. (Tops are optional; this is a sensual space, not a sexual space.)
6- We are here to connect with others. Connection can be verbal, platonic, or spicy!
7- We welcome diversity. Isms and Phobias are not welcome here!

**Who should attend:**
People who are interested in safely exploring touch and sensuality with strangers. This includes people who are single, people who are not single, couples, folks who are new to town and looking for connection, people of all/any genders and sexual orientations, people of all ages (18 and up). People who understand and respect consent, who will take care of themselves and people around them. This event is queer-normative. The guest list will include all genders, orientations, ages, and personalities. If that’s not your thing… This is not the event for you.
***Who should NOT attend:***
-People who are only looking for a sex party.
-People who do not understand and respect consent.
-People who have extreme fear of setting and speaking their personal boundaries; in order to create a safe space we need to know that you will say “no” if you feel a no.
-People who are homophobic, racist, sexist, ageist, ableist…
-People under 18 years of age.
***Schedule of the Evening***

* 6:45pm Doors Open, Mix & Mingle
* 7:00pm We gather in a circle to meet each other, build a container, cover consent and boundary setting and discuss event agreements. Then we will play a few intimacy building games to meet and connect with other people in the room. Please make sure you arrive on-time!
* 8:15pm Once the container is built we will have self directed snuggling and sensual interactions until the end of the party.
* 10:50pm Closing Circle; a time to re-center and connect as a group to verbally share anything that came up at the event or to voice gratitude to someone(s) you enjoyed interacting with.
* 11:00pm cleanup & head home; you are welcome to help.

**We take individual and group safety seriously!** If you experience, see, or know that one of our participants is not safe to be at this event we want to know about it. We are committed to doing our best to create a safe environment which means that if someone is causing harm (physical or mental) that person is not welcome here (this includes harm that takes place outside of our events). We stand behind survivors and know that some of our participants are here to heal from touch based trauma.

These events are not "gender balanced"[. Check out our website for more information about this decision. ](http://holdmeavl.com/why-i-dont-gender-balance-events/)

**Simple definitions/clarifications-** Platonic- marked by the absence of romance or sex.
Most of the interactions we have with friends and strangers are platonic.
Sensual- gratification of the senses or the indulgence of appetite.
We might feel sensual when we feel someone's breath on our neck or experience a extra long and slow caress.
Sexual- having or involving sex.
Often involving one more more peoples genitals; perhaps seeking orgasm.
\*Refund Policy- Full refund if you cancel 7 days before the event or you cancel due to illness, emergency, or direct exposure to covid. Credit towards a future event if you cancel more than 3 days before an event. No refund if you cancel within 2 days of the event or no-show.

Robert Lester Folsom
When: Sun, Dec 7, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $29.75
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY ROBERT LESTER FOLSOM Robert Lester Folsom is a Georgia-born singer-songwriter and guitarist whose music blends soft psych, Americana, and sun-faded AM gold into a sound unmistakably his own. First self-released in 1976, his cult-classic LP Music and Dreams quietly circulated in the Southeast before slipping into obscurity—until crate diggers and reissue labels revived his recordings in the 2010s. The album was re-released in 2014 by Anthology Recordings (a Mexican Summer imprint), bringing Folsom's homegrown vision to a new generation of listeners. Following that rediscovery, Folsom's previously unheard material was brought to light through Ode to a Rainy Day: Archives 1972–1975 and Sunshine Only Sometimes: Archives Vol. 2—two acclaimed compilations of heartfelt demos that deepened his reputation as a lost master of homespun pop. A wave of younger fans has discovered Folsom's music through Instagram, TikTok, and sync placements in hit shows like Outer Banks and Gossip Girl. After only a handful of rare appearances over the years, he's now riding that resurgence—actively touring and performing to packed rooms nationwide, including a sold-out night at The Troubadour and a celebrated set at Newport Folk Festival. Folsom's latest archival single, "Sitting on the Moon," is out now as part of Mexican Summer's latest eponymous compilation, offering yet another lost gem from this storied vault. A third full-length collection of archival material, Archives Vol. 3, is slated for release in 2026.

Rodriguez, Sternberg & Sergel
When: Mon, Dec 8, 12:00 AM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Unknown
Host: Little Jumbo Bar
Tags: Live Music, Nightlife
Description: When three master musicians converge at Little Jumbo Bar, expect the unexpected. Jacob Rodriguez brings his world-traveling baritone sax-seasoned from Michael Bublé's Grammy stages to Brooklyn's underground scenes-ready to paint midnight stories with reed and breath. Quinn Sternberg anchors the room with bass lines that don't just walk, they architect entire musical conversations, transforming rhythm section duties into chamber music poetry. Al Sergel completes the triangle with his genre-fluid drumming philosophy, equally comfortable crafting beats for jazz legends and pop sensibilities. This isn't just a trio-it's three musical chameleons who've learned that the most interesting sounds happen when you refuse to stay in one lane. Rodriguez channels everything from Hard Bop Explosion fire to Congolese mysticism, Sternberg builds gravitational centers that make everyone else sound better, and Sergel treats musical boundaries as suggestions waiting to be reimagined. In Little Jumbo's intimate setting, where every note matters and every silence speaks volumes, prepare for an evening where San Antonio street corners meet conservatory training, where midnight iPhone memos become full-fledged statements, and where three master storytellers prove that the best conversations happen without words. \*Sometimes the most profound music comes from the spaces between genres.

November/December Book Club: North Woods by Daniel Mason
When: Mon, Dec 8, 6:00 PM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Free
Host: Asheville Book Club Meetup
Tags: Book Club, Community, Education
Description: For our next book club, we will be discussing North Woods by Daniel Mason. We will attempt to return to Zilicoah and see how it goes indoors. There are heaters and a cozy section in the back.

**As we discussed recently, Meetup is charging the fee for running the group again. If you haven't contributed in a while, or feel like you could or want to contribute more, I appreciate any help and whatever you are comfortable with doing! Thank you so much for your help and for continuing to show and up and support the group. I look forward to seeing you at the next meeting. You're welcome to bring cash in person or send to my Venmo whenever! It's Tobias-Roth-2**

The description for the book reads:

A sweeping novel about a single house in the woods of New England, told through the lives of those who inhabit it across the centuries—a daring, moving tale of memory and fate from the Pulitzer Prize finalist and author of The Piano Tuner and The Winter Soldier.

When a pair of young lovers abscond from a Puritan colony, little do they know that their humble cabin in the woods will become home to an extraordinary succession of inhabitants . An English soldier, destined for glory, abandons the battlefields of the New World to devote himself to apples. A pair of spinster twins survive war and famine, only to succumb to envy and desire. A crime reporter unearths a mass grave, but finds the ancient trees refuse to give up their secrets. A lovelorn painter, a conman, a stalking panther, a lusty beetle; as each one confronts the mysteries of the north woods, they come to realize that the dark, raucous, beautiful past is very much alive.

Traversing cycles of history, nature, and even literature, North Woods shows the myriad, magical ways in which we’re connected to our environment and to one another, across time, language and space. Written along with the seasons and divided into the twelve months of the year, it is an unforgettable novel about secrets and fates that asks the timeless how do we live on, even after we’re gone?

Description: ALL AGES SEATED SHOW LIMITED NUMBER OF PREMIUM SEATING TICKETS AVAILABLE Honky Tonk Holiday Show! Bill Kirchen and his Turtle Doves will make a stop on their annual Honky Tonk Holiday Tour at The Grey Eagle on Mon 12/8. Featured is a sleigh-full of rarely heard holiday numbers from the blues, rock ‘n' roll and honky tonk bags: "Silent Surfin' Night," "Truckin' Trees for Christmas," "Santa Claus Wants Some Lovin," and more. But be ye not afraid, there'll be so much more than holiday songs of questionable taste; you can count on a truckload of dieselbilly classics, rockers, and country weepers to take the edge off the holiday fuss. So mark your calendars and check 'em twice - Santa Claus is back in town! BILL KIRCHEN Bill Kirchen is one of the fortunate few who can step on any stage, play those trademark guitar licks which he created for the seminal Commander Cody classic, "Hot Rod Lincoln," and elicit immediate recognition. As a founding father of the proto-Americana group Commander Cody and his Lost Planet Airmen, Kirchen wrought a diesel-fueled guitar hook that drove their Hot Rod Lincoln into the Top 10 nationwide. Kirchen went on to the Grammys where he was nominated for Best Country Instrumental in 2001. He has recorded with Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe, Dan Hicks, Maria Muldaur, Hoyt Axton, Hazel Dickens, Gene Vincent and Link Wray, and has toured the world as guitarist with Cody, Nick Lowe, Hoyt Axton and Emmylou Harris. Bill Kirchen was inducted into the Hall Of Fame of the Washington DC Wammie Music Awards in 2001, alongside Dave Grohl and John Phillip Sousa. He joined a remarkable list of prior inductees including Bo Diddly, Duke Ellington, Ruth Brown, Marvin Gaye, Patsy Cline, Shirley Horn, Emmylou Harris, Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Casady. His recent disc, Transatlanticana, entered the Americana Radio Chart Top 10 in 2018, joining his extensive catalogue of over 2 dozen albums, from the Commander Cody discs on through his current 12 releases on the Proper and Last Music Company labels. Bill's latest releases are Back from the Ozone, a Lost Planet Airmen reunion CD out in October 2023 and, from 2021, the LPs Waxworks and Tombstone Every Mile, along with The Proper Years and Tombstone on CD and in all digital formats, all on the Last Music Company label.

The Bistro has an outdoor S'mores pit!

Six of the twelve trolls are lit up for Winter Lights. It's a very different view of these six at night.

This is a ***walking*** tour so dress warmly in good shoes. We'll meet at **Discount Shoes near the Arboretum at 6:15**. We can pile into two cars there and won't have to ride very far to the show. Tickets are by car load so crowding in is worth it. We'll divide up the ticket cost when we arrive.

Please RSVP if you want to join the group. We are limiting attendees to 12 people and no guests on this one so we can fit into two cars.

Let's hope for a clear night with low winds. We are only outside for about an hour with a building on each end of the tour it is easy to get inside, warm up, and head back out! As long as it isn't windy the cold is fine. **If the weather is threatening we'll cancel by 11am on December 8th.**

Price: Free
Host: SeekHealing Asheville
Tags: Art, Wellness, Spiritual
Description: You will be provided with your sanitized supplies, or feel free to bring your own colored pencils, markers, or other art supplies to express yourself during this Connection Practice Meeting.

A Connection Practice is a meeting to practice your skills in listening and connecting with others. No conversation topic is off limits. The only objective of the meeting is to feel a genuine sense of connection by the time it's over, and the only rule is that we promise to not give each other advice.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates. All connection practices are free of charge.

Description: Something extraordinary is coming to Asheville this winter! The North Carolina Arboretum and Explore Asheville are elated to announce the arrival of Trolls: A Field Study. Visiting on their first North American excursion, these twelve interactive troll sculptures will explore the Arboretum, embarking on a curious journey to learn about humankind. 

Produced by Imagine in collaboration with Danish artist Thomas Dambo, these friendly and fanciful sculptures evoke a sense of wonder and intrigue as they study our small, intricate and inventive ways of life in Western North Carolina. Standing seven to nine feet tall and lovingly described by the artist as “Baby Trolls”, the creatures are crafted from materials like fallen branches, wooden pallets and twigs. 

Through their observations, the trolls reveal a fresh perspective on what makes us human, sparking curiosity and laughter in visitors of all ages.

The display of gingerbread houses features whimsical and elaborate handmade gingerbread houses of every size, shape, complexity, and theme. A must-see! You will see everything from rustic cabins to elaborate castles — all built from edible materials and made of at least 75% gingerbread. Contestants from all over the country submit their creations from across four age categories \~ adult, teen, youth, and child.

Besides seeing the gingerbread houses enjoy the enormous fireplaces, dozens of decorated Christmas trees with different themes, and the historic beauty of the Grove Park Inn. Also, treat yourself to their homemade hot chocolate or a hot toddy from the bar. That’s what I plan on doing! I want a hot-buttered rum and to sit in one of the rocking chairs in front of that huge fireplace! Ahhhh! 🔥 🍹

To read more about all that is offered at the Inn google The National Gingerbread House Competition for there are many articles and beautiful photos of gingerbread houses. You can also go to: www.omnihotels.com.

PARKING: Admission is free, but parking certainly isn’t!
Valet: $40 for day parking
Self-parking: $30 for day parking
The proceeds from parking benefits local non-profits.

IMPORTANT: I encourage car-pooling due to the price of parking. If you’re willing to do so please comment in the comment section for this meetup event.

DAWN/CARPOOLING: Dawn has a nice-size Flex Ford and can accept four more passengers. Nataliia & I are already riding with her. The first four to respond get the seats. We will be doing the valet parking for $40 plus tip. Split seven ways it will be about $7-$8 per person. Beats paying the whole $40!
If you wish to carpool with Dawn please text me (no phone calls, please, for I work and my phone will be off) or email me. All others who wish to let others ride with them please make a comment in the comment section.

Dawn & I will be having breakfast there prior to leaving for the Grove Park Inn. Come join us or just come before we depart (Again, for details please look at separate meetup event for IHOP). I know this is a lot of info. so text or email me with any questions.

DINING: I tried to get dining at the Inn, but for a large group they now require you to pay in advance for everyone with only one credit card. No can do. I also wanted the Sunset Terrace, but they close in early November. Several of the restaurants are seasonal. But if you want something to eat while there they do serve food at their many on-site bars & restaurants (that are not seasonal).

Again, please text or email me (info. above) if you wish to carpool (first come, first serve) with Dawn or if you simply have some questions.

For those not carpooling with Dawn I will meet you inside the main entrance of the Inn at 11:30 AM. I’ll be in the area of the big fireplace. Text or call me if you can’t find me. (828)699-8180. Hope to see you there! Tis the season! 🎄 🎄🎄

Surrounding ourselves with other writers who are busy putting words onto page (physical or virtual) keeps us all accountable and focused.

When the timer goes off, we'll check-in with each other and see how it went. Afterward, feel free to stay to chat and get to know your fellow writers, or keep writing, or take off.

Socializing is optional and will happen after (or briefly before) the focused writing. This is a safe space to work on your craft. No one will read or critique your writing.

**Being late is okay:** Just show up and get settled, then check in with the host after the session. (Look for the person with the Shut Up & Write sign).

**What Should I Bring?**

* Whatever you need to be able to write!
* Earbuds/earplugs if you want to block ambient noise.

**Other Important Details:**

Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino & Holiday Book Swap
When: Tue, Dec 9, 6:30 PM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Free
Host: Books That Age Like Wine
Tags: Theater & Film, Holiday, Markets
Description: **please bring a new or old book to play secret santa**

Calvino’s beloved, intricately crafted novel about an Emperor’s travels—a brilliant journey across far-off places and distant memory.

With cities, it is as with dreams: everything imaginable can be dreamed…

In a garden sit the aged Kublai Khan and the young Marco Polo—Mongol emperor and Venetian traveler. Kublai Khan has sensed the end of his empire coming. Marco Polo diverts his host with stories of the cities he has seen in his travels around the empire: stories about memory and desire, art and creation, life and death. As Marco Polo unspools his tales, the emperor realizes these fantastic places are more familiar than they appear.

With a brilliant new introduction from Pulitzer Prize winner Anthony Doerr, and dreamlike illustrations of the cities interspersed throughout, this edition breathes new life into Calvino’s classic, a celebration of the story’s profound invention and enduring insight.

On 2nd and 4th Tuesdays of the month from 7-8:30pm, we gather for an **Intuitive Development Circle.** This is a welcoming, supportive space for folks of all levels of experience.

***Why Develop Your Intuition?***
-Make Confident Decisions – Trust your gut in work, relationships, and life.
-Sharpen Your Perception – Discern what’s yours vs. external influences.
-Stronger Connections – Read the room and understand people deeply.
\- Boost Creativity & Problem\-Solving – Access new ideas and solutions\.
\- Stay Balanced & Grounded – Navigate challenges with clarity and ease\.
-Advance Your Career & Growth – Recognize opportunities and align with your path.
-Reduce Stress & Overwhelm – Focus on what truly matters.

Circles may include a combination of: meditation, exercises to develop our skills, opportunities to practice intuitive readings with self/pairs/small groups, discussions about all things intuition-related, etc. Topics will shift circle to circle depending on group interests and experience level.

Price: $31.81
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGES FULLY SEATED SHOW LIMITED NUMBER OF PREMIUM SEATING TICKETS AVAILABLE MIKE COOLEY Mike Cooley is an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter, best known as a member of the Southern rock band Drive-By Truckers. The Alabama musical style blends elements of rock, country, and Americana, and he is recognized for his sharp, evocative lyrics and distinctive guitar work. As one of the band's primary songwriters, Cooley has written numerous iconic tracks for Drive-By Truckers, with his songs often exploring themes of personal introspection, Southern identity, and social commentary. Alongside bandmate Patterson Hood, Cooley has been a driving force behind the band's evolution since their formation in the late 1990s, contributing to their gritty, honest sound and critical success. In addition to his work with the band, Cooley has pursued a solo career, releasing his debut solo album The Fool on Every Corner in December 2012. The album showcases his storytelling prowess and ability to create poignant, introspective songs with a more stripped-down, intimate sound compared to his work with Drive-By Truckers. Known for his wit and keen observational style, Cooley's solo work highlights his versatility as an artist, cementing his place as an influential figure in contemporary American roots music.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates.

Eilen Jewell
When: Wed, Dec 10, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $24.60
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGES PARTIALLY SEATED SHOW (please note seated VS standing room only options at checkout) EILEN JEWELL Hailed by American Songwriter as "one of America's most intriguing, creative, and idiosyncratic voices," Eilen Jewell rises from the ashes on her captivating new album, Get Behind The Wheel, picking up the pieces of her shattered world and finding new purpose and meaning after watching her marriage, her band, and what felt like her entire career fall apart in a series of spectacular, heartbreaking implosions. Co-produced by multi-instrumental wizard Will Kimbrough (Todd Snider, Hayes Carll), the collection pushes the acclaimed singer and songwriter's trademark blend of vintage roots-noir into more psychedelic territory, with spacious, cinematic arrangements complementing her revelatory explorations of grief, loss, resilience, and redemption. An Idaho native, Jewell built her career the old fashioned way, touring relentlessly with the kind of undeniable live show that converts the uninitiated into instant acolytes. Over the course of nine albums, she's crisscrossed the globe countless times and shared bills with the likes of Lucinda Williams, Loretta Lynn, Mavis Staples, Wanda Jackson, George Jones, and Emmylou Harris. Rolling Stone lauded Jewell's "clever writing," while NPR declared that she has a "sweet and clear voice with a killer instinct lurking beneath the shiny surface," and The Washington Post mused that "if Neko Case, Madeleine Peyroux and Billie Holiday had a baby girl who grew up to front a rockabilly band, she'd probably sound a lot like Eilen Jewell."

Dodgeball Open Play (ages 21+)
When: Thu, Dec 11, 7:00 PM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Free
Host: Dodgeball AVL
Tags: Fitness, Nightlife, Sports, Community
Description: **This is an outdoor event so weather can affect our Meetup. We do not play in rain, temps below 40F, or other adverse weather conditions. Keep on eye on the weather and check group updates to stay informed. ** Waitlisted players, please still consider attending! We only sit players if games have reached capacity. That’s 12v12 for one court and 11v11 for 2 courts. We usually have less people at the beginning after setup (~7:15pm) and the end of the night (after 9pm). That said, we are growing in attendance so play time is not guaranteed for the waitlist and those who do not sign up. Ready to dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge? Come show us what you got with Asheville’s weekly pick-up dodgeball group! We're hosting open play on Thursday night at Asheville Sports Club. We are all about having a great time and getting that adrenaline pumping! Friendly competition is always welcome but fun, safety, and respect for all players are the top priorities. We use squishy rubber dodgeballs that are fun to throw and catch but can sting with enough velocity so no headshots are allowed. Throws should aim at your target’s shoulders or lower. No experience is necessary - we'll teach you the rules. Open to adults 21 and up (bring your ID!). We’re sorry but we cannot accommodate teens or children because there is alcohol on the premises and no one wants to be the person who accidentally hurts a kid. Sign waivers at the bar before playing and enjoy a beverage between games. Rules of the game are covered at the start of the event so please be there at 7pm to learn our format. We loosely follow the USA Dodgeball ruleset with some exceptions to help new players adapt to the game more quickly. Check out our brief rules and expectations summary attached as photos to this Meetup. Here’s an approximate schedule for this event depending on when people arrive: 6:50 - 7:10pm* - Set up courts and mingle - help with set up is appreciated! 7:10 - 7:15pm - Rules and announcements 7:15 - 9:30pm - Play! *If we have enough people once setup is done, we’ll jump into rules and announcements early. We need at least 8 players to start a game, so take advantage of the daylight and try to arrive right at the beginning! Since this is a free event, the more community support we can gather, the better experience everyone will have, especially for the organizers! If you'd like to help, please arrive early or stay late to assist with set up and breakdown. This is a free community offering, however, if you are feeling generous, donations are welcomed to help support and expand our group. We take donations through Pledge here in Meetup or Venmo (dodgeballavl). Cash of course is great too and more effective as there are no platform fees. Your donations genuinely help the group by helping with equipment purchases and raising funds to eventually add another night of dodgeball in an indoor gym. This event would not be possible without the support of Asheville Sports Club. Please consider generously tipping your bartenders and karaoke DJ as well.

In-Person Connection Practice Meeting
When: Fri, Dec 12, 1:00 PM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Free
Host: SeekHealing Asheville
Tags: Wellness, Spiritual, Community, Support Groups
Description: A Connection Practice is a meeting to practice your skills in listening and connecting with others. No conversation topic is off limits. The only objective of the meeting is to feel a genuine sense of connection by the time it's over, and the only rule is that we promise to not give each other advice.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates.

Camino de Asheville - Section 5 - W Asheville Loop 7.3 mi.
When: Fri, Dec 12, 5:45 PM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Free
Host: The Asheville Hiking Group
Tags: Fitness, Outdoors, Dining
Description: Join me for an evening loop hike in West Asheville.

**Meeting Spot:**
We'll gather at the Gassaway Field in West Asheville. GPS: 35.5713858225791, -82.59893427473918.

**Pace:**
We'll be walking at a brisk 2.5 to 3.0 mph, leaning more toward 3.0 mph, even uphill. Please be mindful of your fitness level, but don’t worry—we'll take breaks at a few spots to let everyone catch up. While we’ll pause, we can’t wait too long, so come ready for a solid workout!

**No-Shows:**
I’ll be keeping an eye on no-shows. If you RSVP and don’t show up without changing your RSVP or letting me know ahead of time, you may end up on the waitlist for future hikes.

**Waitlist:**
Regular hikers may get bumped up from the waitlist because I want to emphasize community first, but if you are a regular that stops attending for a few months, you could lose that priority. Make sure to check your RSVP status, even on the day of the hike, as it might change at the last minute! People tend to drop out left and right sometimes. If you're still on the waitlist, please don't show up. Plus-ones for people on the waitlist aren’t allowed—let's keep it fair for those eager to join!

**Bringing a Plus-One:**
If you’re bringing a friend, please select the +1 option when you RSVP or edit your response. It helps me keep an accurate headcount! Make sure your guest is also up for the pace and distance.

**Optional Rucking:**
I will bring along a weighted pack (rucking) for an extra challenge, but it's totally optional! Rucking is great training for backpacking. If you’re carrying more than 15 lbs, I recommend a proper backpack designed for heavy loads to prevent discomfort or injury. If you’re new to this, start light!

**Eats/Drinks:**
We will eat at the Universal Joint.

Johnson released a new solo album, Diamond City, on April 4th, 2025, and was also part of the 2009 collaboration Molina and Johnson, a record for which a tour was canceled due to Molina's struggles with alcohol.

Expect multiple sets and a solemn yet celebratory evening in memory of Jason Molina — their bandmate, collaborator, and friend. Magnolia and Johnson Electric Co. (featuring Will Johnson along with original Magnolia Electric Co. members Mike Brenner, Jason Evans Groth, Michael Kapinus, Mark Rice, and Pete Schreiner) will also convene in Texas ahead of the tour to record new studio versions of both Molina's and Johnson's songs, much in the vein of the 2018 Goshen Electric Company collaboration between Magnolia and Tim Showalter of Strand of Oaks.

Tanner Burch & the Hill Hippies | The Showroom
When: Sat, Dec 13, 1:00 AM
Where: Fitz and the Wolfe, 1 Battery Park Ave, Asheville, NC
Host: Fitz and the Wolfe
Description: Tanner Burch has lived about nine lives—and somehow turned them all into songs. From All-American linebacker to honky-tonk road warrior, his path runs through heartbreak, hard work, and one beat-up 1985 Ibanez that changed everything. His sound?

When: Sat, Dec 13, 12:00 PM
Where: Clyde, NC
Price: Free
Host: Haywood County Walking Meetup Group
Tags: Outdoors, Tours, Pets, Holiday
Description: Meet inside the Baker Visitor Center at 12:00 p.m. Restrooms are available at the start point.

We will walk down Running Cedar Road, cross over on Bent Creek Road, and then climb the Carolina Mountain Trail back to the Education Center. Then we will tour the formal gardens before we leave.

Dress for the weather. Some may want walking poles. Sneakers should be fine, unless it has rained recently. Be sure to bring plenty of water and a protein snack.

Dogs on leash are welcome, but are not allowed in buildings or the Bonsai Exhibit. Trail strollers should be ok.

Of course, the Troll Exhibit will be going on. You may want to stay after our walk to seek out other trolls. The Winter Lights will also be up, though they won't be lighted. Again, you may want to return in the evening (at additional expense) to view this unique annual spectacular.

The NC Arboretum does not have an admission fee, but they charge $20 per car parking fee (so pack as many people in your car as you can). We recommend for the driver to purchase the lowest level annual membership which includes free parking. (Of course, you may want a higher level membership, your choice.) We walk at the Arboretum at least six times per year.

Price: Free
Host: Mary Magdalene Circle of Sacred Connection
Tags: Wellness, Spiritual
Description: Our December group theme is Emotional Healing & Fortification with the Marys. A gentle Magdalene immersion to soothe, strengthen, and fortify the heart—held in the Frequency of Love.

Step into an inviting sacred space of **alchemical co‑creation** to unlock your intentions for unity, empowerment, love, and grace‑filled transformation—through the living presence of **Mary Magdalene**.

The **Divine Feminine is rising** through each of us and through the planetary collective. Within every being, the inner feminine and masculine long to return to **harmony, balance, and joy**. As a spiritual mentor for our evolving times, Mary Magdalene embodies sovereignty, love, truth, faith, and surrender—luminous attributes of spiritual mastery. Together, we will invoke her presence (and the angelic realms) in a circle of sacred connection to honor the **return of the Sacred Mother** to Earth.

Guided by **Modern Alchemy™** and **neuroscience based nervous‑system care**, we’ll tend the tender places—grief, overwhelm, and fatigue—while **fortifying the inner temple**. Expect meditation, breath and sound, Frequency Flows™, and gentle ritual for **visceral clearing, alignment, and activation**. As a Myrrhophore, **Adora** will offer **anointing and initiation with rare, ancient aromatics**, inviting a deeper felt sense of blessing and devotion.

This is a monthly **in‑person** gathering at **The Well Asheville**. Come as you are; leave resourced, centered, and held in community. **All are welcome.**

**You’ll Receive** \- A guided **Magdalene‑Rose attunement** for emotional soothing
\- A simple **ANR™ nervous‑system sequence** for at‑home care
**\- Myrrhophore anointing** with rare and ancient aromatics
\- High Frequency meditation and **Mary blessing** for peace and protection

**Come nourish yourself, fill your cup from the sacred well of the feminine Creatrix.**

This is a monthly in person event at The Well Asheville.

**This program is $33 or by donation. All are welcome.**

**[Save Your Space](https://thesoulinstitute.as.me/schedule/125382e8/?appointmentTypeIds%5B%5D=85008296 "https://thesoulinstitute.as.me/schedule/125382e8/?appointmentTypeIds\[\]=85008296")**

***Do you hear a calling TO RISE deep within you?***

***The Divine Feminine is rising.*** It is ascending through the collective consciousness of the planet and through you from your soul to your cells. We all have aspects of inner feminine and masculine that desire to return to unity, empowerment, and love. Remembrance of this holy truth is emerging. The resounding call within you is more than just a whisper and it beckons you to reawaken the ancient wisdom, divine knowledge, and vast love that is held within you.

Our Divine Feminine Rising Program is offered through both free and paid programs, in-person and virtual events to reach and embrace the most expansive net of our global community. We are ready and ripe to rise and stand in the fullness of your power, love, and truth.

**[Free Monthly Mary Magdalene Transmission Meditations](https://thesoulinstitute.co/events-and-retreats/mary-magdalene-monthly-transmission-meditation-01224 "https://thesoulinstitute.co/events-and-retreats/mary-magdalene-monthly-transmission-meditation-01224")**[:](https://thesoulinstitute.co/events-and-retreats/mary-magdalene-monthly-transmission-meditation-01224 "https://thesoulinstitute.co/events-and-retreats/mary-magdalene-monthly-transmission-meditation-01224") Each month, we will gather to connect and commune with the essence of this visionary aspect of divine feminine. We will explore the alchemy of Mary Magdalene in relationship to her Divine attributes of mysticism, love, sacred sexuality, Divine adoration, surrender, faith, and unity consciousness to awaken deeper levels of the Divine feminine to RISE with YOU.

Through daily ceremony and healing meditations, Adora guides us on journeys of the sacred human heart.

**[Ceremony:](https://thesoulinstitute.co/ceremony-1 "https://thesoulinstitute.co/ceremony-1")** Ceremony and ritual are rooted in ancient traditions as a practice of alchemy in the processes of transmutation, transfiguration, and transformation.

Casual chat + coffee or more, Sunday mornings 10-noon
When: Sun, Dec 14, 10:00 AM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Free
Host: Atheists of WNC
Tags: Dining, Trivia, Wellness, Networking
Description: **We hope you will come meet some of the group** this coming **Sunday morning** **(10AM - noon)** or some time soon. We meet every Sunday at **Earth Fare's cafe** for just conversation among like-minded non-believers.
In addition, two Sundays per month we also have a **Book Club** that meets at **Standard Pizza on Biltmore**. We also have Wednesday evening meetings at either **Boodas Brewing or Trailside in Hendersonville** once a month. You should receive emails about each of those events and are welcome to attend.
Please sign up here in Meetup to receive notices about our activities. There are no dues. Thanks!

Our newly-formed group has 100+ members already. Our conversation groups are usually 10-15 people and have been excellent. We chat about atheism, but also about **other things that are not related to religion** etc at all.

**None of us believe in religion.** Some of us wonder if "the universe" or something energy-related affects our lives, while others feel that someday science will be able to explain time-without-beginning and other mysteries.

**Until further notice our Sunday get togethers will be 10AM - noon** at the **cafe at Earth Fare.** RSVP is requested but not required.

The address is **66 Westgate Pkwy, Asheville**. **Earth Fare** is a large and excellent "health supermarket". It's in the Westgate Shopping Center, which is right off Patton after crossing the bridge on 240 West. Earth Fare is at the far end of the parking lot. There is plenty of free parking. They have a **very nice cafe** that you'll find off to the left after entering the store. The grocery area also has some good deals - see https://www.earthfare.com/#about

We’ll have a sign so you can see what table(s) we are using. Bringing kids and dogs is not recommended.

Because we appreciate each participant, **suggestions and input are welcome**. Let's start with **your input** about these things...

1. Is 10AM Sunday a good time for you? Would another time or another day be better for you?
2. Do you have other coffee houses or breakfast places to suggest?
3. Might you be interested in joining our trivia contest group? It's another fun way to hang out with like-minded people (other Atheists).
4. Is there some other kind of get together you'd like to organize? It could be one-time or recurring. Some possibilities - movie club, bowling...who knows? Perhaps an online Zoom chat?

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates.

Description: ALL AGES SEATED SHOW LIMITED NUMBER OF VIP MEET & GREET PACKAGES AVAILABLE INCLUDING: One premium seating ticket with guaranteed seating in the first 3 rows VIP early entry into the venue Exclusive meet & greet with The Secret Sisters Personal photograph with The Secret Sisters Access to a private pre-show soundcheck performance Q&A session One tour poster, autographed Commemorative meet & greet laminate Merchandise shopping opportunity before doors open to public THE SECRET SISTERS Since their 2010 self-titled debut, The Secret Sisters have brought their spellbinding harmonies to songs that untangle the thorniest aspects of life and love and womanhood. In the making of their new album, Mind, Man, Medicine, Alabama-bred siblings Laura Rogers and Lydia Slagle found their songwriting transformed by a newfound sense of self-reliance and equanimity, threading their lyrics with hard-won insight into the complexities of motherhood, commitment, compassion, and self-preservation in an endlessly chaotic world. Centered on a kaleidoscopic sound that boldly blurs the edges of country-folk, the duo's fifth full-length ultimately confronts many of modern life's harshest challenges while leading the listener toward a more open-hearted state of mind. The follow-up to Saturn Return—their 2020 Grammy-nominated LP co-produced by Brandi Carlisle and lavishly praised by the likes of Rolling Stone—Mind, Man, Medicine finds The Secret Sisters co-producing alongside Ben Tanner (Alabama Shakes, St. Paul & the Broken Bones) and John Paul White (formerly of Grammy-winning duo the Civil Wars). "On Saturn Return we'd gotten much more confident as far as directing the sound of the record and knowing how to capture our voices in the most honest way, so it felt like the right time for our first foray into production," says Rogers. The latest in a series of critically lauded releases, the album came to life at FAME Studios (the historic spot in their hometown of Muscle Shoals) and at Sun Drop Sound in nearby Florence, with contributions from such esteemed musicians as Alabama Shakes bassist Zac Cockrell and legendary multi-instrumentalist Larry Campbell (Paul Simon, Willie Nelson, Levon Helm). Looking back on the creation of Mind, Man, Medicine, The Secret Sisters reveal that the immense support of their fans played a major role in their willingness to tread previously uncharted emotional terrain. "I remember playing a show last fall and expressing my gratitude to the crowd that they'd come out to see us, because as mothers of young children we now understand how challenging that can be," says Rogers. "Later on that night a woman came up to us with her daughter and husband and said something like, 'I know it's so hard to leave your babies—but you leaving your babies at home for a little while is what makes moments like this happen for other families.' It was so gratifying to hear that, and reminded me of the whole purpose behind the music that we make: it's to benefit the hearts of other people, anyone who needs that healing or validation or connection, or even just the space to cry. That's why we keep doing this." CALEB ELLIOTT

Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Free
Host: Shut Up & Write!® Western North Carolina
Tags: Networking, Community, Education, Book Club
Description: Shut Up & Write!

**Here's how it works.** Show up at or before 6:00. At 6:00, we do some quick introductions. Afterward, for a full 60 minutes (I'll set a timer!) we are heads-down writing. Writing what? A novel? You bet. Some poetry? Sure. Song lyrics? Your resume? That report you need to get to your boss before 8 AM or you'll *need* *to write* that resume? All of the above and more. Just shut up and write.

Surrounding ourselves with other writers who are busy putting words onto page (physical or virtual) keeps us all accountable and focused.

When the timer goes off, we'll check-in with each other and see how it went. Afterward, feel free to stay to chat and get to know your fellow writers, or keep writing, or take off.

Socializing is optional and will happen after (or briefly before) the focused writing. This is a safe space to work on your craft. No one will read or critique your writing.

For more information about our events, visit [https://shutupwrite.com](https://shutupwrite.com).

**What to Expect**

* Roughly 15 minutes of introductions
* 60 minutes of focused writing (somebody set a timer)!
* Afterward, optional socializing

**Being late is okay:** Just show up and get settled, then check in with the host after the session. (Look for the person with the Shut Up & Write sign).

**What Should I Bring?**

* Whatever you need to be able to write!
* Earbuds/earplugs if you want to block ambient noise.

**Other Important Details:**

HOSTS: This is a multi-host event, so most of the time there will be a host present. If we are unlucky and no host can attend, please find each other and self-organize. Pay attention to the event chat and comments to see who is available.

WI-FI: Yes!

PARKING: Street parking in metered spots is free after 6pm. Closest municipal garages ($2/hour) are Wall St. & Coxe Street/Sears Alley.

When: Tue, Dec 16, 6:00 PM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Free
Host: Awakening Asheville
Tags: Wellness, Spiritual, Community
Description: Join us for a welcoming and inclusive New Moon Circle, where all bodies and all genders are invited to participate in this sacred gathering. This event is a beautiful opportunity to pause, reflect, and align with the energies of the New Moon—a powerful time for setting intentions and manifesting our desires for the month ahead.

Our circle will begin with a grounding meditation, creating a space for relaxation and inner connection. Together, we will share our personal intentions, holding space for one another in a supportive and non-judgmental environment. We will also dive into the astrological influences of the New Moon and other energetic currents, discussed in an accessible way that resonates with both beginners and seasoned practitioners.

By the end of the circle, you will leave with greater clarity and purpose, feeling empowered to take inspired action as you move forward into the new lunar cycle. Whether you're new to moon rituals or a longtime participant, this circle will offer insight, connection, and a sense of renewal.

Come as you are—everyone is welcome. Let’s harness the magic of the New Moon together!

Bring your friends and remember to carpool!

This is a free event.

**All donations are welcome to help support the use of the event venue.**

**What to Bring:**

* A journal and pen
* Please bring any comfort items you may desire: blankets, pillows, bolsters, eye mask, etc. We do not yet have enough community items for everyone.
* An altar item - this can be a photo, crystal, something you found in nature that you desire to help hold the imprint of our time together.
* Your sober self. This is a sober event, meaning no substances other than your own sacred being.
* Curiosity and an open mind and heart

**Our Circle Agreements**

🌑 **All are welcome.** There is no competition or hierarchy here—no one is above or below another. We meet as equals, honoring the wisdom within each of us.

🌑 **Self-awareness over judgment.** If judgment arises (because we are human), see it as an opportunity for self-reflection. We are all mirrors for one another.

🌑 **Confidentiality and respect.** This is a safe and sacred space. What is shared here stays here.

🌑 **Honor your needs.** Move as you need to—get water, use the restroom, grab a tissue. You are a sovereign being and can care for yourself as needed.

🌑 **Emotions are sacred.** There is no need to hold back, apologize, or adjust your emotions to fit others. Your experience is your own medicine.

🌑 **Witness, don’t fix.** We honor each other as whole beings. We hold space for one another without assuming needs or rushing to console. Simply witnessing is enough.

The 2025 Christmas Yarn Ball
When: Tue, Dec 16, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $24.60
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family, Holiday
Description: ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY YARN You might expect a band that calls itself Yarn to, naturally, tend to spin a yarn or two. "That's what we do, we tell stories, live and in the studio, truth and fiction",singer/songwriter Blake Christiana insists. "We don't always opt for consistency. There's a different vibe onstage from what comes through in our recordings. There's a difference in every show as well, you never know what you're going to get." Yarn's ability to persevere ought to come as no great surprise, especially for a band that spent two years honing their chops during a Monday night residency at the famed Kenny's Castaway in New York's Greenwich Village. In effect, it allowed them to rehearse onstage, mostly in front of audiences that often ranged in size from five to a hundred people on any given night. 10 studio albums followed -- Yarn (2007), Empty Pockets (2008), Leftovers Part One (2009), Come On In (2010), Leftovers Part 2 (2011), Almost Home (2012), Shine the Light On (2013), This Is The Year (2016), and Lucky 13 parts 1 & 2 (2019). The band then took to the road, playing upwards of 170 shows a year and sharing stages with such superstars as Dwight Yoakam, Charlie Daniels, Railroad Earth, Marty Stuart, Allison Krauss, Leon Russell, Jim Lauderdale, Leftover Salmon, Amos Lee, The Lumineers and many more. They've driven nonstop, made countless radio station appearances, driven broken-down RVs and watched as their van caught fire. They've paid their dues and then some, looking forward even as they were forced to glance behind. Indeed, the accolades piled up quickly along the way. They have landed on the Grammy ballot 4 times, garnered nods from the Americana Music Association, placed top five on both Radio and Records and the AMA album charts, garnered airplay on Sirius XM, iTunes, Pandora, CNN, and CMT, been streamed millions of times on Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon, and also accorded the "Download of the Day" from Rolling Stone. Shine the Light On found shared songwriting credits with John Oates (the Oates of Hall & Oates fame), and when audiences expressed their admiration, it brought the band a populist cult following of diehard devotees, popularly known as "the Yarmy." It's proof positive that the Brooklyn and Raleigh based band have made their mark, and in dealing with their emotions, scars and circumstances, they find themselves in a position to share those experiences with others who have juggled similar sentiments The beginning of the journey to these 2 albums began around April of 2022 when Blake booked a solo show at The Down Home in Johnson City, TN (a nod to Townes Van Zandt's 1986 live show there and ultimate release) with the intention of making a live record. But he wanted it to be songs none of the fans and attendees had ever heard before. The problem was he hadn't written most of them yet. He was at his crossroads, uninspired, bored, exhausted and fairly insecure about his entire career up to that point. But he got to work, and got more inspired with each new song he wrote. These songs all tell a story individually but they also tell a story as a whole, a songwriter and musician ready to dive deeper into the music and the art for a greater result that he believes most anyone can appreciate, relate to and enjoy.

Dillon Fence
When: Wed, Dec 17, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $27.06
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family, Holiday
Description: ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY DILLON FENCE Dillon Fence – Greg Humphreys, Kent Alphin, Chris Goode, and Scott Carle – returns to North Carolina this December with a run of dates to celebrate the 35th anniversary of their debut full-length album, Rosemary, released in 1992 through NC-based indie label Mammoth Records. Produced by rock legend Ron St. Germain, Rosemary represents a culmination of years of performing and songwriting and helped forge a special connection with fans. Their signature pop rock LP holds some of the band's best-known and loved songs Rosemary helped the Fence become one of the biggest regional draws of that time – roaming the college circuit, always returning to their home base, indie rock Mecca Chapel Hill, NC. The band's college town jangle had a touch of soul and a youthful romanticism decidedly out of step with '90s nihilism. Follow-up LPs Outside In and Living Room Scene reflected the sonic influence of alternative rock while retaining their dedication to harmony and songcraft. Tours across the U.S. and Europe supporting X, Hootie & The Blowfish, and The Black Crowes followed. The band unofficially broke up in 1995; however, since 2000, Dillon Fence has reunited regularly to play shows for their appreciative fans and celebrate music that defines a special time for the band and the fans. Celebrate the 35th anniversary of Rosemary and get into the holiday spirit with Dillon Fence this December!

Solstice Snuggles Dec 20th
When: Sat, Dec 20, 6:50 PM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Free
Host: Asheville Cuddle Collective
Tags: Wellness, Spiritual, Community
Description: Please note- If you want to attend this event you need to purchase a ticket- We advertise in many places and only paid tickets will reserve your space.[ ](https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/community-cuddles-dec-20th)**[Click HERE to register!](https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/community-cuddles-dec-20th)**

**This is a non-sexual touch based event that invites participants to explore platonic intimacy in a safe environment** with like-minded people. We respect personal boundaries and through a supportive framework of mutual agreements that maximize safety and create a space of easy openness and compassionate connection.
At this event we have the chance to normalize touch with clear boundaries; this is a space for respectful, consent-based touch. We allow ourselves to be seen. We have fun.
We welcome people of all backgrounds, genders, ethnicities, relationship styles, sexualities, sizes, and ages (18+).

**THE RULES**
1\. Clothes stay on for the whole event\.
2\. You do not have to touch anyone at this event\.
3\. You must receive a verbal YES before you touch anyone\.
4\. Take care of yourself and those you choose to interact with\.
5\. Speak up if you have a question\, concern\, or if you need assistance with anything during the event\.
6\. All emotions are welcome\- we love vulnerability\.
**WHY CUDDLE?**
Touch is a basic human need, and many of us do not get enough; most people don’t even know they are missing touch, or have a way to ask for touch without sexualizing it. We believe deeply in the power of touch, and the importance of communication and consent in creating a safe space for touch.
CUDDLING WITH STRANGERS
Cuddling with strangers sounds weird or scary to most people. “Will I like it?” “What if someone wants to touch me and I don’t want to?” “What if I say yes and it’s not what I want?” “What if I really want to touch someone and they say no?” These are all normal questions. The answer is that this is a space created to ask for exactly what you want, and receive NOTHING you don’t want. Many people start out nervous at a cuddle event & most are really glad they came.

**Schedule:**
6:45-7pm: Arrive with snacks to share! Get comfortable, meet, mingle, & snack.
7:05pm: Welcome Circle- its mandatory. We will set our container, talk about personal boundaries, communication, & consent.
7:15pm: Icebreakers and connective activities.
8:00pm: Open cuddling! You MUST ask and get a verbal ‘yes’ before touching or cuddling with anybody at this event. If you are not sure how to do this – great! – we will talk about it during the welcome circle.
10:50pm: Closing Circle, cleanup and head home.
**ETIQUETTE**

* ARRIVE ON TIME: It is important that all participants arrive before the Welcome Circle. The Welcome Circle serves the purpose of creating the safe space for consensual, non-sexual touch between participants and making sure that everyone is informed about consent.
* Please arrive clean & as scent free as possible.
* BE SOBER: Please do not drink or smoke before or at this event.

**WHAT TO BRING:** personal water bottle and snacks to share, a friend, a date – whatever cuddle accessories you like! The only thing that you are required to bring is a clean and sober you.

These events are not "gender balanced".

**We take individual and group safety seriously!** If you experience, see, or know that one of our participants is not safe to be at this event we want to know about it. We are committed to doing our best to create a safe environment which means that if someone is causing harm (physical or mental) that person is not welcome here (this includes harm that takes place outside of our events). We stand behind survivors and know that some of our participants are here to heal from touch based trauma.

\*refund policy-
Full refund if you cancel 7 days before the event or you cancel due to illness, emergency, or direct exposure to covid/flu.
Credit towards a future event if you cancel more than 3 days before an event.
No refund if you cancel within 2 days of the event or no-show.

💻 >>hack day<< Remix & Refine: AI Design Jam
When: Sun, Dec 21, 10:00 AM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Free
Host: AVL Digital Nomads
Tags: Education, Networking, Community
Description: *Forget tutorials. Learn by doing. We’ll start with five minutes of vibecoding tips, then spend the morning building whatever your imagination (and AI) can handle.*

🎨 **Sunday, December 21 · 10am–1pm**
**Bring a laptop + tiny idea = Leave with something beautiful**

***

**💭 What We’re Doing**
This one’s all about creativity. It’s called **“Remix & Refine: AI Design Jam.”**

We’re going to explore how to use AI to remix design ideas, refine rough layouts, and make something that *looks* good, even if you don’t consider yourself a designer.

This is a chill, hands-on build session. We’ll kick off with a short talk on design remixing, then spend most of the morning experimenting, swapping prompts, and making things shine.

Vibecoding = you describe what you want → AI builds the scaffolding → you guide it to greatness.

This time, we’ll focus on the *vibe* part of vibecoding, remixing style, structure, and flow.

***

**🎙 Mini Talk: Remix Like a Builder, Refine Like a Designer**

1️⃣ *Steal smart* – Good design starts with reference, not a blank screen.
2️⃣ *Remix with intent* – Copy structure, then inject your own flavor.
3️⃣ *Prompt visually* – Use tone words (“sleek,” “cozy,” “retro webcore”) to guide the AI.
4️⃣ *Iterate fast* – Generate three options before committing to one.
5️⃣ *Refine to finish* – Polish spacing, text, and color before you call it done.

We’ll look at a few AI-generated layouts, remix them live, and show how small prompt changes completely shift the vibe.

***

**🎯 What You’ll Actually Do**

**Track 1: “Remix It”**
• Start with a base design or layout (we’ll share one).
• Use AI tools like Lovable.dev or v0.app to remix it: change colors, layout, or tone.

**Track 2: “Refine It”**
• Take your existing app or landing page and polish the look.
• Ask AI to improve readability, spacing, and visual hierarchy.

**Track 3: “Rebrand It”**
• Give your project a total visual makeover: new fonts, palette, or theme.
• Use prompts like “make this feel like a cozy indie productivity app.”

**Bonus Track: “Remix Battle”**
• Everyone starts from the same simple app template.
• Build your remix in 60 minutes.
• Show your version: funniest, weirdest, or most elegant wins bragging rights (and probably stickers).

***

**🪩 Reality Check**
This isn’t about being a professional designer. It's about learning by remixing.
You’ll get comfortable using AI to *see design*, not just generate it.
Good taste comes from doing lots of small, low-stakes experiments.

## 🛠️ Your New Superpowers (The Tools We'll Use)

**For Mobile:**

* **Bolt.new + Expo** – Text-to-app that actually works on phones
* **Cursor** – Your IDE but with an AI copilot who actually understands context
* **Emergent** – AI-powered mobile development platform
* **Rork** – Rapid mobile prototyping with AI assistance

**For Web:**

* **Vercel v0.dev** – Generates UI components you'd actually want to keep
* **Lovable.dev** – Chat your way to full-stack apps
* **Replit Agent** – For when you need an AI junior dev for longer tasks

**Command Line tools:**

* **Claude Code** – Agentic coding from your terminal with excellent guardrails
* **Gemini CLI** – Open-source terminal agent that actually understands your codebase
* **GitHub Copilot CLI** – Chat in terminal, ship PRs like a boss
* **OpenAI Codex** – Direct access to GPT models for coding workflows

**OR copy/paste from Claude + ChatGPT** – Sometimes the simplest solution is the best solution

***

## 📅 The Plan

**10:00–10:30 Speed Dating for Ideas**
Pitch your tiny build in 30 seconds. Find your coding buddy. No idea? We have a hat full of them (including "Tinder for finding tennis partners" and "Which friend owes me money tracker").

**10:30–12:30 The Build Sprint**
Two full hours to build! Pick a track. Steal our prompts. Break things. Fix things. Ship something real. We'll be circulating with "oh wait, try this prompt" tips.

**12:30–1:00 Victory Lap / Demos**
Show your creation. Share your killer prompt. Drop your deploy link in the chat. Everyone will clap even if it's wonky.

***

## 🎒 What to Bring

* **Laptop + charger** (mandatory)
* **Headphones** (for focus mode)
* **One tiny idea** (or steal one from our idea jar)
* **Low expectations, high curiosity** (perfect combo)

## 🤝 Who Should Come?

* **Founders / aspiring founders** who want to start working on that business idea
* **Developers** who want to 10x their building speed
* **Designers** who want to make their designs real
* **Product people** who want to test ideas instantly
* **Complete beginners** who think "deploy" is a military term (we'll teach you!)
* **AI skeptics** welcome – see what's actually possible vs hype

## 💡 You'll Leave With:

✅ A deployed thing you built (with a real URL!)
✅ 3-5 battle-tested prompts you can reuse forever
✅ Actual understanding of how people are shipping with AI today
✅ New friends who also think building stuff is fun
✅ The dangerous confidence to build your next idea

## ⚡ The Fine Print

**Cost:** Free (bring your own coffee / snacks)
**Skill Level:** "I can open a laptop" to "I deploy to prod on Fridays"
**Mood:** Collaborative chaos with good intentions

## 💌 Questions?

Drop us a line in a DM or in a comment down below
Join the conversation: **#ai** channel in [Digital Nomads Slack](http://bit.ly/3xpzEAL)

## 🌈 Code of Conduct

Build cool stuff. Help others build cool stuff. Don't be a jerk. That's it.

Host: Shut Up & Write!® Western North Carolina
Tags: Networking, Education, Community, Book Club
Description: Shut Up & Write!

**Here's how it works.** Show up at or before 6:00. At 6:00, we do some quick introductions. Afterward, for a full 60 minutes (I'll set a timer!) we are heads-down writing. Writing what? A novel? You bet. Some poetry? Sure. Song lyrics? Your resume? That report you need to get to your boss before 8 AM or you'll *need* *to write* that resume? All of the above and more. Just shut up and write.

Surrounding ourselves with other writers who are busy putting words onto page (physical or virtual) keeps us all accountable and focused.

When the timer goes off, we'll check-in with each other and see how it went. Afterward, feel free to stay to chat and get to know your fellow writers, or keep writing, or take off.

Socializing is optional and will happen after (or briefly before) the focused writing. This is a safe space to work on your craft. No one will read or critique your writing.

For more information about our events, visit [https://shutupwrite.com](https://shutupwrite.com).

**What to Expect**

* Roughly 15 minutes of introductions
* 60 minutes of focused writing (somebody set a timer)!
* Afterward, optional socializing

**Being late is okay:** Just show up and get settled, then check in with the host after the session. (Look for the person with the Shut Up & Write sign).

**What Should I Bring?**

* Whatever you need to be able to write!
* Earbuds/earplugs if you want to block ambient noise.

**Other Important Details:**

HOSTS: This is a multi-host event, so most of the time there will be a host present. If we are unlucky and no host can attend, please find each other and self-organize. Pay attention to the event chat and comments to see who is available.

WI-FI: Yes!

Dec 24th An EVE-ning of Spicy/Sensual Snuggles
When: Wed, Dec 24, 6:50 PM
Where: Asheville, NC
Price: Free
Host: Asheville Cuddle Collective
Tags: Holiday, Wellness, Dating, LGBTQ+
Description: Please note- If you want to attend this event you need to purchase a ticket- We advertise in many places and only paid tickets will reserve your space. **[CLICK HERE TO PURCHASE YOU TICKET AND RESERVE YOUR SPACE FOR THIS EVENT.](https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/dec-24-an-eve-ning-of-sensual-snuggles)**[ ](https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/dec-24-an-eve-ning-of-sensual-snuggles)

**Holidays can be hard. Sometimes laying in someone's arms is helpful to calm our system. Come simmer in the sweetness of a sensual cuddle event.**
**What is a Sensual Snuggle Event?**
This is a sweet & welcoming event where we practice and use verbal consent to connect and share touch. We talk about boundaries and practice both saying and receiving a “no”. In this space it is common to see people cuddle, share massage, have their hair brushed, kiss, expose nipples, play, laugh, cry, and be vulnerable. This is a sober space where we can relax and connect with other humans who are seeking touch based connection.
We strive for this to be a safe event. Safe touch enhances our ability to connect with and trust people. When we are in a space of safety, we are able to relax, feel comfort, and be vulnerable.

**Our Agreements:**
1- We ask for what we want an wait for a yes before touching others.
2- We say no if we don’t want to do something.
3- We try to receive a no with grace and not take it personally.
4- We arrive on time, clean (as scent free as possible), and sober.
5- We keep our pants/shorts on at this event. (Tops are optional; this is a sensual space, not a sexual space.)
6- We are here to connect with others. Connection can be verbal, platonic, or spicy!
7- We welcome diversity. Isms and Phobias are not welcome here!

**Who should attend:**
People who are interested in safely exploring touch and sensuality with strangers. This includes people who are single, people who are not single, couples, folks who are new to town and looking for connection, people of all/any genders and sexual orientations, people of all ages (18 and up). People who understand and respect consent, who will take care of themselves and people around them. This event is queer-normative. The guest list will include all genders, orientations, ages, and personalities. If that’s not your thing… This is not the event for you.
***Who should NOT attend:***
-People who are only looking for a sex party.
-People who do not understand and respect consent.
-People who have extreme fear of setting and speaking their personal boundaries; in order to create a safe space we need to know that you will say “no” if you feel a no.
-People who are homophobic, racist, sexist, ageist, ableist…
-People under 18 years of age.
***Schedule of the Evening***

* 6:45pm Doors Open, Mix & Mingle
* 7:00pm We gather in a circle to meet each other, build a container, cover consent and boundary setting and discuss event agreements. Then we will play a few intimacy building games to meet and connect with other people in the room. Please make sure you arrive on-time!
* 8:15pm Once the container is built we will have self directed snuggling and sensual interactions until the end of the party.
* 10:50pm Closing Circle; a time to re-center and connect as a group to verbally share anything that came up at the event or to voice gratitude to someone(s) you enjoyed interacting with.
* 11:00pm cleanup & head home; you are welcome to help.

**We take individual and group safety seriously!** If you experience, see, or know that one of our participants is not safe to be at this event we want to know about it. We are committed to doing our best to create a safe environment which means that if someone is causing harm (physical or mental) that person is not welcome here (this includes harm that takes place outside of our events). We stand behind survivors and know that some of our participants are here to heal from touch based trauma.

These events are not "gender balanced"[. Check out our website for more information about this decision. ](http://holdmeavl.com/why-i-dont-gender-balance-events/)

**Simple definitions/clarifications-** Platonic- marked by the absence of romance or sex.
Most of the interactions we have with friends and strangers are platonic.
Sensual- gratification of the senses or the indulgence of appetite.
We might feel sensual when we feel someone's breath on our neck or experience a extra long and slow caress.
Sexual- having or involving sex.
Often involving one more more peoples genitals; perhaps seeking orgasm.
\*Refund Policy- Full refund if you cancel 7 days before the event or you cancel due to illness, emergency, or direct exposure to covid. Credit towards a future event if you cancel more than 3 days before an event. No refund if you cancel within 2 days of the event or no-show.

The Cheeksters + Doss Church and the Unholy Noise
When: Sat, Dec 27, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $18.45
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY THE CHEEKSTERS The Cheeksters were formed in 1990 soon after Mark and Shannon met by chance on a train in London, England. Mark hails from the UK, while Shannon was born and raised in Tennessee. They started performing music together as a duo with Mark on guitar and vocals and Shannon playing bass guitar. They soon released their debut album " Stranger Things Have Happened " in 1992, followed by " Hey, What's Your Style ? " in 1994. The couple relocated to Nashville in 1996 and began working with producer Brent Little at his all analog studio Cream Puff Recorders. So far they have recorded four critically acclaimed albums at Cream Puff - " Skating On The Cusp " ( 1999 ) , " Nineteen Sixty Five " ( 2005 ) , " Movers and Shakers " ( 2007 ) , " The Golden Birds " ( 2011 ) – and are currently hard at work on a new record. Over the years The Cheeksters have performed extensively in the SouthEast US, as well as showcasing their talents in NYC and London. Their songs have been recently placed with the NFL and Coca-Cola for commercial use, gaining them wide exposure and new fans. The Cheeksters combine the best of what made music great in the 1960's with a winning, fresh pop approach that delights audiences. In the studio the group has produced six albums of timeless, tuneful, terrific pop that has real staying power. Onstage the versatile four-piece band turns out its straightforward catchy pop confections, bringing to mind a swirling variety of influences : Memphis soul, Carnaby Street pop, swampy rhythm and blues, and more. They somehow manage to channel Burt Bacharach / Hal David pop, Dusty Springfield's diva soul, T-Rex's manic boogie and the pomp of David Bowie often in the same song without sounding derivative. The current line-up has performed together for the past seven years and is made up of Mark Casson ( vocals, guitar, piano ) , Shannon Hines Casson ( vocals, bass guitar ) , Jay Moye ( piano, guitar ) and Mike Baker ( drums ). DOSS CHURCH AND THE UNHOLY NOISE Doss Church & the Unholy Noise is an Asheville-based Americana Rock & Roll band that plays a mix of originals written by singer/songwriter Doss Church, along with a wide range of crowd-pleasing cover songs. Doss Church is a seasoned songwriter who fuses soulful, heartfelt vocals with warm, expressive acoustic guitar. His deeply storied, personal lyrics are filled with hope found and love lost. The Unholy Noise combines Americana, Country, and Folk Rock influences that range from the 60's to today and delivers a sound that feels both new and old at the same time. The honest songwriting, veteran musicianship, and electric stage presence of the entire group make for a truly moving live performance.

New Year's Eve with ELECTRO LUST
When: Wed, Dec 31, 9:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $26.86
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Holiday, Family, Nightlife
Description: ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY ELECTRO LUST Welcome to the world of Electro Lust! Where Electronic Funk pulses through the veins, entwined with a stampede of live Beats and Brass. This musical journey begins with a deep connection between electronics and live musicians, ignited by a passion for multi-cultural rhythms that echo across the festival scene Their odyssey into the realms of Funk, Latin, Cuban, and Afrobeat reads like a musical adventure, spawned from encounters with diverse cultures while on the road and under the influence of vinyl treasures unearthed in record shops scattered across the nation. At the core of Electro Lust beats the hearts of Grammy Award-winning artists from Asheville, NC's musical scene - Yo Mama's Big Fat Booty Band, The Fritz, Empire Strikes Brass, & Marcus King Band. Step into the soundwaves of Electro Lust, and suddenly you're whisked away, careening from the neon-lit confines of a Miami nightclub, drifting to the sun-soaked sands of a Brazilian beach, and finally landing amidst the vibrant chaos of Cuban streets. All the while, the soundtrack to this journey is an eclectic hip-hop mix tape, a melodic manifesto that defies convention and invites you to lose yourself in the raw energy of the Electro Lust experience. Strap in and let the music guide you through this electrifying tapestry of sound and sensation. AUSPICIOUS GOLDEN FISH Swimming in an ocean of sound, Auspicious Golden Fish weaves together searing guitar riffs, hypnotic synth textures, and deep funk grooves into a transcendent musical experience. Guitarist/producer Jamie Hendrickson (The Fritz/ElectroLust) assembles a revolving lineup of all-star musicians that bring his compositions to life. The result is a sonic journey—one that invites listeners to dissolve the ego, embrace the present moment, and dance into higher states of consciousness.

Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGESSTANDING/DANCING ROOM ONLY BEACH ATTIRE ENCOURAGED! THE GET RIGHT BAND The Get Right Band's "Summer in the Winter BEACH BASH" with special guests, Supatight! The sunny good times are going down on Friday, Jan 9th at The Grey Eagle. We're talking beach balls, tropical decorations, and most importantly, a contest for "best dressed." BEACHY ATTIRE ENCOURAGED! Tix on sale now, get 'em while they're hot (get it? hot? cause it's a summer thing?). The Get Right Band is a psychedelic indie rock group committed to relentlessly following their muses to honest self-expression, to whatever excites them and pushes them into unexplored territory, to capturing some version of truth. American Songwriter writes that the Asheville, NC based group, "filters 60's/70's psychedelia and 90's alternative rock through a modern lens–as if Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and Nirvana co-wrote an album produced by Danger Mouse and Dan Auerbach." The Get Right Band formed in 2011, built around the musical brotherhood that guitarist/singer/songwriter Silas Durocher and bassist Jesse Gentry have formed playing music together since middle school. Durocher, who is a trained composer and has been commissioned to write for symphonies and chamber groups, has guitar chops that can soothe or rage, with a charismatic swagger as frontman and singer. Gentry's virtuosic bass playing "catapults from elastic to nasty" (The Mountain Xpress). Completing the team is drummer extraordinaire Jaze Uries, who is also a singer, songwriter, producer, photographer, and DJ, and keys legend Chuck Lichtenberger, whose incredible playing has been a staple of the Asheville music scene for years. GRB has defined their sound through constant evolution, building to the hook-driven, synth-heavy pop/rock/psych band they are today. The Huffington Post writes, "their songs are infectious and take you immediately to a place. The lyrics are smart and bear weight." SUPATIGHT

Painted, printed, cut, and sewn scrolls show these stories as the cranker tells and sings them, inviting the audience along on the journey. The handmade meets the heartfelt, and the simple act of cranking becomes a spell — winding time, memory, and imagination together.

Ondara Presents The Jet Stone Conspiracy
When: Sun, Jan 11, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $24.60
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY FULL BAND SHOW ONDARA PRESENTS THE JET STONE CONSPIRACY Every artist's journey is a quiet revolution. For some, there comes a moment when Robert Zimmerman becomes Bob Dylan, when Reginald Dwight becomes Elton John, when David Robert Jones becomes David Bowie, when Ali Ibrahim becomes Ali Farka- it's a moment, when such an artist leaves behind the comforts of history in search of boundless expression- a moment when they metaphorically move out of their home, stepping into the unknown, and surrendering to the wild embrace of their muse. This chapter of my journey mirrors that kind of transformation. My new band, The Jet Stone Conspiracy, is the culmination of my rebirth- It's a surrender to the currents of free expression- an invitation to explore new realms of sound, movement, and poetry. The first mission of this new chapter is to come visit you with my band and share the songs from Tales of America, Tales of Isolation, and Spanish Villager No:3– all brought to life for the first time in a full-band setting. This will be my first time touring with a band– an invitation to experience with you the music that has led us to this point, in an expanded and dynamic form, and to hear the new material I'm exploring for the upcoming debut release of The Jet Stone Conspiracy. Much love,JS Ondara Announces Special Winter Run: Introducing His New Band Project — The Jet Stone Conspiracy Some transmissions don't come through a radio. They arrive in a dream, unannounced, and crystal clear. Born in Nairobi and reborn in America, J.S. (Jet Stone) Ondara's path has always been one of restless searching — from discovering Bob Dylan in a teenage dispute to teaching himself guitar after moving to Minneapolis alone, eventually earning a Grammy nomination for his debut album Tales of America and sharing stages with Neil Young, The Lumineers, and Lindsey Buckingham. After years of quiet searching and restless wandering, Ondara returns to the stage transformed. Following his Rebirth Tour, he stepped away from the spotlight, journeying across continents in pursuit of new personal and creative horizons. From that search, he emerges as Jet Stone — his true name — stepping into a new chapter with his new band project, The Jet Stone Conspiracy. This fall, Ondara will embark on the first full-band tour of his career. This special run is more than just a series of concerts; it's an invitation into a world rebuilt from the ground up. A chance to witness a rare moment of transformation in real time. Each night, Ondara, now performing as Jet Stone, will breathe new life into beloved songs from his catalog while offering a first look at new material from his upcoming debut as The Jet Stone Conspiracy. For longtime fans, it's an opportunity to reconnect with the music that started it all — now charged with a fresh, urgent energy. For new listeners, it's an entry point into an evolving story of transformation, reinvention, and artistic freedom.

Ruston Kelly – Pale, Through the Window Tour
When: Thu, Jan 15, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $32.81
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY RUSTON KELLY Since making his debut with 2018's Dying Star, Ruston Kelly has built a catalog of songs that search for transcendence in the most devastating and demanding of experiences: addiction, the strenuous work of self-evolution, the fallout of broken relationships. But in the writing of his latest album, the South Carolina-born artist found himself in unfamiliar emotional territory—a state of sustained joy and inner peace, brought on by a spiritual breakthrough and the dawning of a new love. Brimming with the grit and depth that's always defined his output, Pale, Through the Window ultimately affirms Kelly as one of modern music's most astute observers of the human heart and spirit. The follow-up to The Weakness—a 2023 release that earned major acclaim from the likes of Rolling Stone, The New York Times, NPR and led to his appearance on "Late Night with Seth Meyers"—Pale, Through the Window finds Kelly reuniting with his longtime collaborator Jarrad K, who also helmed production on Dying Star and 2020's Shape & Destroy. The first body of work he's recorded with his longtime touring band, the album centers on a singular sonic palette that often merges synth with pedal-steel guitar while fully embracing Kelly's ardent love of classic pop-punk and emo—ultimately bringing a raw and potent energy to his soul-searching songwriting. Over the course of Pale, Through the Window's 13 songs, Kelly offers up everything from the somber rumination of the LP's title track and the rueful longing of "Twisted Root" (an intimate look at his history with addiction) to the radiant open-heartedness of love songs like "Waiting to Love You" and "Wayside" (a euphoric but unvarnished portrait of love against the backdrop of a world in flames). And in sharing such an all-embracing account of his journey to acceptance and peace, he aspires to provide others with the courage to persevere through their own personal chaos. "If someone's struggling with doubt or hopelessness because of the state of the world or their relationship with God or with themselves, I hope this record leaves them with the sense that it can be okay and that love truly is the most powerful force we have available to us," says Kelly. "I also hope they feel at least a sliver of the freedom and joy I felt in writing these songs—even if they're just having a good time bobbing their head to 'Waiting to Love You,' I want everyone to be reminded that the world can be a joyful place." verygently verygently is the collective force of three established Nashville singer-songwriters—Drew Erwin, Joey Hendricks, and Tristan Bushman—who came together in early 2024. With tours alongside Augustana, The Band Camino, and The Fray, combined with their debut EP, the band quickly turned heads thanks to their high-energy live shows and songs that blend wit and vulnerability, weaving heartache with the undeniable charm of three best friends sharing the stage.

Fred Eaglesmith
When: Fri, Jan 16, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $56
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGES SEATED SHOW FRED EAGLESMITH Fred Eaglesmith, the Canadian singer-songwriter and roots music icon, has spent over five decades carving out a singular path in the music world. Known for his raw, storytelling lyrics, gravelly voice, and unapologetic independence, Eaglesmith has become a cult hero to fans of Americana, folk, and country music. Born in rural Ontario in 1957, he ran away from home at 15, hopping freight trains and living a nomadic life that would later fuel the vivid, working-class narratives in his songs. With a career spanning more than 25 albums, Eaglesmith has earned a reputation as a prolific and uncompromising artist. His songs, often laced with wit, heartbreak, and a touch of rebellion, have been covered by legends like Toby Keith, Alan Jackson, Miranda Lambert and countless more. Tracks like "Time to Get a Gun" and "Freight Train" have become anthems for the disenfranchised, while his live performances- equal parts rock show and revival meeting- have cemented his status as a must-see act. Eaglesmith, along with his multi-instrumental wife, Tif Ginn, have teamed up with a new band, The Velvet Frogs, injecting fresh energy into their timeless sound. The Velvet Frogs bring a dynamic, genre-blurring edge to Eaglesmith's music, blending his signature rootsy grit with psychedelic undertones and a dash of rock 'n' roll swagger. Together, they're reimagining his classic tunes and introducing new material that proves Eaglesmith is as vital and inventive as ever. No longer a road warrior, Eaglesmith is now only playing select and curated dates, as a duo with Tif Ginn, as well as with The Velvet Frogs. He continues to push boundaries, defy expectations, and remind us why he's one of the most enduring and enigmatic figures in modern music. Whether you're a longtime devotee or a newcomer to his world, one things for sure: Fred Eaglesmith is still writing his story, one unforgettable song at a time.

YAIMA is a music project featuring multi-instrumentalist and producer Masaru Higasa and vocalist Pepper Proud. Their sound has often been described as timeless and unmistakable, offering a balanced synergy of both masculine and feminine expression.

Their melodious soundscapes incorporate instruments from around the world and draw deep inspiration from the majesty of nature. YAIMA’s music blends driving, revitalizing organic rhythms with transcendent electronic production, warm soothing vocals, and heartfelt lyricism.

Their intention is to create a bridge between nature and humankind—an expansive experience that encourages growth and gentle transformation for the hearts and minds of their listeners.

The name YAIMA comes from two sources: the Mapudungun phrase meaning “that which water runs through,” and the culturally preserved Yaeyama district of Okinawa, Japan.

Over the last five years, YAIMA’s music has reached audiences across the globe, resonating with listeners from all walks of life.

---------------------------
The AETHER ceremony is held within the live musical field of YAIMA, whose ethereal vocals, global instruments, and atmospheric rhythms create a sacred soundscape for inner exploration. Their music sets the tone for the journey — spacious, heartfelt, and gently guiding participants into a ceremonial state of presence.

The ceremony begins with a heart-opening invocation, honoring the ancestors, the directions, and the land. This creates a grounded and intentional container, inviting participants to soften into their hearts and arrive fully into the space. Following this, guests are welcomed with a cup of sustainably sourced cacao from a small family farm in Guatemala, a gentle plant medicine that supports emotional presence and inner connection.

From this warm and centered foundation, Jade Lyons guides guests through a Conscious Connected Breathwork journey. Jade’s facilitation is gentle yet powerful — an invitation to breathe, soften, and meet oneself with compassion. His intuitive approach creates a supportive field where clarity and insight can rise naturally.

Throughout the experience, YAIMA’s live music becomes the atmosphere of the journey, weaving through the breath and illuminating the inner landscape. Their sound elevates the process, helping participants move into deeper states of awareness, peace, and emotional transparency.

The ceremony concludes with a grounding sound meditation, offering space for integration before participants transition into the rest of their evening.

Chatham County Line
When: Thu, Jan 22, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $24.60
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGESPARTIALLY SEATED SHOW (guaranteed seating AND standing room only tickets are available at checkout) CHATHAM COUNTY LINE Launched a little more than twenty years ago in Raleigh, North Carolina, Chatham County Line built a devoted local following on the strength of their genre-bending live show—an intoxicating blend of bluegrass, folk, country, and rock and roll—before breaking out internationally with their 2003 self-titled debut. In the years to come, the band would go on to release eight more critically acclaimed studio albums, top the Billboard Bluegrass Chart four times, collaborate with the likes of Judy Collins, Sharon Van Etten, and Norwegian star Jonas Fjeld, earn two gold records in Norway (where they were also twice nominated for the Spellemannprisen, Norway's equivalent of a Grammy), and share bills with everyone from Guy Clark and Lyle Lovett to Steve Martin & Martin Short and The Avett Brothers. NPR hailed the group as "a bridge between bluegrass traditions and a fresh interpretation of those influences," while Uncut lauded their "powerful melodies and gorgeous harmonies," and Pitchfork dubbed their music "timeless." The band's latest release, Hiyo, marks the band's first release since the departure of their longtime banjo player and serves as something of a reintroduction to the roots stalwarts, complete with new sounds, new collaborators, and a whole new lease on life. Recorded at Asheville's Echo Mountain studio with co-producer/engineer Rachael Moore (Kacey Musgraves, Robert Plant and Alison Krauss), the collection finds the trio—Dave Wilson (lead singer/guitarist), John Teer (fiddle/mandolin) and Greg Readling (bass/pedal steel), embracing change at every turn, experimenting with fresh sonic palettes and innovative approaches to their core instrumentation. The songwriting remains classic Chatham County Line here—rich, evocative tales of love and heartbreak, joy and sorrow, righteousness and revenge—but the settings have evolved to incorporate synthesizers, drum machines, and more electric guitar and percussion than ever before. Given the group's string band roots and decades spent singing around a single microphone, the results are nothing short of revelatory, taking an enduring sound and injecting it with a thrilling new spirit of discovery and vitality.

Description: ALL AGES SEATED SHOW LIMITED NUMBER OF PREMIUM SEATING TICKETS AVAILABLE THE CODY SISTERS The Cody Sisters band is the very heart of contemporary acoustic Folk and Bluegrass music in Colorado, the United States and the UK. Their propulsive instrumental solos and warm harmonies combine to grip the listener. Along with their bass player Will Pavilonis, sisters Megan (guitar, mandolin, vocals) and Maddie (guitar, banjo, vocals) have forged a new sound that has no equivalent match in the acoustic world today. In May of 2023, The Cody Sisters released their self-titled EP marking a new beginning for the band. It is their first release since parting ways with their former image of "young girls in a family band" and it portrays a sense of maturity and musical understanding that reveals a new dimension to their artistic expression. They set out to explore new sounds and styles while still holding true to their bluegrass roots, and they have done just that. This new music is an invitation to connect, to feel, and to journey together through original lyrics and captivating instrumental arrangements. The Cody Sisters have a sound that is original, exhilarating, and heartwarming all at the same time. With strong ties to traditional American acoustic music, they continue to stun their audiences both in the US and abroad.

Friendship w/ Natalie Jane Hill
When: Sun, Feb 1, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $20.91
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY FRIENDSHIP Music for sleeping and waking, walking and driving, hunting and fishing, for loitering outside a roadhouse on the haunted tundra. Okay in elevators, not great for dinner. On Caveman Wakes Up Friendship's new album and second for Merge Records, the band's historically capacious definition of country music grows wider still. Shambolic guitars are offset by flute pads, bleary poetry is set against a Motown rhythm section, a song about Jerry Garcia and First Lady Betty Ford fades out with a drum solo, like if Talk Talk came from a dingy Philadelphia basement, and was fronted by James Tate. Songwriter Dan Wriggins' ragged baritone cuts through eleven murky, swirling country-rock songs with profound lyrical substance and sincerity. Like an alarm clock incorporated into the edge of a dream, Caveman Wakes Up belongs equally to the conscious and subconscious mind, fraught with background, steeped in reference and experimentation, delivered casually and as a dire warning, dedicated, above all, to music's creative soul. Over the years, dedication has paid off. Friendship has become a kind of reverse supergroup, wherein the band itself and each individual member is located centrally in an increasingly prominent scene of young folk and country musicians and songwriters. Drummer Michael Cormier O'Leary leads the instrumental collective Hour and, along with bassist Jon Samuels, run Dear Life Records, home to friends and peers who count Friendship as a major influence, including MJ Lenderman, Florry, and Fust. (Samuels also plays lead guitar in MJ Lenderman and the Wind). Guitarist Peter Gill's band 2nd Grade records prolifically. Wriggins began writing the songs of Caveman Wakes Up on a downtuned classical guitar of Lenderman's, and finished on a barely-tuned piano in an apartment he shared with Sadurn's G DeGroot. In the summer of 2023, Wriggins had just left the Iowa Writers' Workshop, where his love for poetry and mistrust for the academic poetry world grew in tandem. A relationship fell apart, and Wriggins crashed for several weeks at Lenderman's and Wednesday's Karly Hartzman's home in North Carolina, where he recorded the first demos of "Resident Evil," "All Over the World," and "Love Vape." Wriggins returned to Philadelphia, and the band got to work on new ideas, finally tracking the album in five days with engineer Jeff Ziegler (Mary Lattimore, War on Drugs). NATALIE JANE HILL Natalie Jane Hill's new record, Hopeful Woman, is composed of slender songs, life-sized, in which humans endeavor to reconcile themselves to wildernesses and cities; rearrange their rooms and open windows to be closer to the world outside and its choruses of frogs and crickets; attempt and fail to reach one another across a kitchen table; weather natural disaster. If something we might deign to call self-discovery emerges over the course of these narratives, it owes in no small part to the scale of their scenes, to the modesty of their ambitions, in which tumult and adaptation and growth are metabolized through a body's gentle actions and reactions, its moments of quietude and observation and reflection. "Into the current of life I will fly," Hill sings on Oranges, a song that would serve her well as a mission statement. "Changing and loving and growing and trying."

Langhorne Slim: The Dreamin' Kind Tour
When: Sat, Feb 7, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $29.75
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY LANGHORNE SLIM For more than two decades, Langhorne Slim has been a fearless voice in modern Americana, known for his raw emotion and rule-breaking spirit. On his ninth album, The Dreamin' Kind, the Nashville-based songwriter plugs in his electric guitar and dives headfirst into big-hearted, 1970s-style rock & roll. Produced by Greta Van Fleet's Sam F. Kiszka, the record pairs power chords and soaring hooks with the vulnerable storytelling that's long defined Slim's work. "It felt like I was blowing some old shit up so I could plant some new flowers," he says. "I love folk music, but rock & roll tickles the same part of my soul. I wanted to explore that." The collaboration began after Slim opened for Greta Van Fleet, leading to loose, inspired sessions with Kiszka and drummer Danny Wagner. Together they built songs that move from the propulsive rush of "Rock N Roll" and the swagger of "Haunted Man" to the tender sweep of "Dream Come True" and "Stealin' Time." Recorded over a year in Nashville, The Dreamin' Kind bridges Slim's rootsy past with a louder, more expansive present. It's a record of freedom and discovery, equally at home in rock clubs and around campfires — proof that Langhorne Slim, ever the dreamer, still finds new ground to break with every song.

Amelia Day
When: Wed, Feb 11, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $20.91
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family, LGBTQ+
Description: ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY AMELIA DAY Amelia Day is a musical jack-of-all-trades. Standing at the intersection of folk, rock, and pop, Day blends heartfelt storytelling, raw delivery, and unforgettable melodies into music that feels both fresh and familiar — like rediscovering an old favorite. A self-described writer before anything else, her perceptive lyricism extends far beyond her 23 years, with lines reminiscent of songwriting greats like Joni Mitchell and Paul Simon. As the Spokesman-Review notes, Day has a signature style that features "wordplay, double-meanings and rhythmic variations," with themes ranging from journeying into adulthood to climate change. Many of Day's songs are also shaped by her intimate relationships, where her queerness and candor take center stage. Day's upcoming EP EGO TRIP is her most personal project yet. Lead single "Lady Los Angeles" traces the sting of betrayal after discovering infidelity, while the rest of the EP takes listeners on an intimate journey through her grieving process. "The character of 'Lady Los Angeles' is representative of my ex's obsession with attention and fame at all costs and my own fear of being seduced by those same temptations," Day explains. "It felt like she was having an affair, not only with another person, but with the often-self-aggrandizing culture of Los Angeles itself." Born and raised in the small town of Sumner, Washington — the self-proclaimed "Rhubarb Pie Capital of the World" — Day has been drawn to music-making since she could walk. "I had no idea what I was doing, but I had a toy ukulele and drum, and my parents had an upright piano that I would mess around on," she recalls. "I could spend hours just playing around on the keys, making up little songs, which my piano teacher recognized and encouraged." By middle school, Day was already writing her own songs "about myself and my (very angsty) preteen feelings." Once Day got to college, she began performing her originals publicly, though not without roadblocks. "I had horrible stage fright up until mid-college," she admits. Starting with farmers markets and local restaurants, Day gradually built up the confidence and the following that would lead to sold-out shows in Seattle, Boston, and D.C., as well as festival appearances at Bumbershoot ("one of my favorite sets I've ever played…there was a line of people outside waiting to get in!"), Capitol Hill Block Party, Folklife Festival, and Seattle PrideFest — all on her own. "I'm proud of getting to this point as an artist completely solo," Day says. Already boasting over a million streams on a number of songs, Amelia Day continues to prove herself as both a songwriter and performer, emerging as a voice destined to resonate for years to come.

Train Songz: An evening with The Asheville Mountain Boys
When: Thu, Feb 12, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle (Special Event)
Price: $25.10
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: - ALL AGES - STANDING ROOM ONLY TRAIN SONGZ: AN EVENING WITH THE ASHEVILLE MOUNTAIN BOYS By their name, you know where they are from, and by their sound, you know what they are about. The Asheville Mountain Boys are on a mission to capture not just the style but the spirit of traditional bluegrass. Asheville, NC has long been known for great music and its roots in bluegrass go back to the founding of the genre (Bill Monroe's first broadcast performance as the Bluegrass Boys was at Asheville radio station WWNC in 1938) A group that firmly stakes its claim to the tradition of the music from the area, The Asheville Mountain Boys spring onto the scene with a thought," What happened to bluegrass?" It's not a disparaging one that condemns current styles in the genre but rather asks, "Why do we love this music in the first place" and answers with an approach that is true to the originators of the genre in the sense of both style and philosophy. Train Songz started as an Instagram meme page. As its audience grew, The Conductor and his trusty engineer Promontory Paul derailed the social media train and took their audience offline with a print fanzine. The first issue of Train Songz was released in January 2024, six months after the meme page got its start, and the zine-team has released quarterly issues since. This show, featuring traditional bluegrass from the Asheville Mountain Boys, will be a launch party for the ninth issue of Train Songz—and the first of 2026, our third year in publication. On top of the music, we'll inject the evening with some Train Songz sensibilities and welcome some friends who dye, bootleg, and peddle other such wares one might find "on lot." We'll have offline-exclusive merchandise and zines, as well! Hope you can join us.

Say She She: Cut & Rewind Tour
When: Sun, Feb 15, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $32.84
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY LIMITED NUMBER OF VIP PACKAGES AVAILABLE, INCLUDING: ● One (1) General Admission ticket ● Invitation to pre-show cocktail hour with Piya, Sabrina and Nya, including: ● Meet & Greet ● Personal photo opportunity ● Q&A Session ● Early access to a cash bar (where applicable) ● Commemorative VIP laminate ● First access merch shopping and a 15% off coupon redeemable at this show only ● Early entry into the venue SAY SHE SHE Thereʼs nothing more resonant than the human voice. It contains timbres and textures no other instrument can replicate, but most importantly, itʼs immensely powerful: One voice can spark an uprising, but many voices in unison create a movement. Nya Gazelle Brown, Sabrina Cunningham, and Piya Malik, the three women who front NYC punk-chic, discodelic band Say She She, understand how to wield such power. They soar above irresistible grooves, locking together in gorgeous three-part harmonies that cleverly disguise the feeling of righteous rebellion permeating their music. Theirs is a multi-pronged call to action: Move your body, expand your mind, and recognize your strength. Say She She, whose name pays homage to Nile Rodgers, made Cut & Rewind, their third record, almost immediately after wrapping the tours supporting 2023ʼs Silver. The bandʼs trajectory has skyrocketed over the past few years, earning praise from The Guardian, the LA Times, MOJO, and NPR, and touring with Thee Sacred Souls. They have performed at venues like the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles and the Roundhouse in London, as well as festivals including Glastonbury, Austin City Limits, and Pickathon. Theyʼve long mined the sounds of the '70s and '80s, citing Minnie Riperton, Rotary Connection, Liquid Liquid, and ESG as influences. Cut & Rewind expands their scope, incorporating elements of Lonnie Liston Smith and the Lijadu Sisters into their sonic palette while channeling the spirit of contemporaries like Lambrini Girls and Amyl and the Sniffers. It all combines into a psychedelic soundscape of pulsing disco beats, astral whistle tones, and earwormy melodies. Katz&ugrave; Oso Katz&ugrave; Oso is a Chicano artist born and raised in the heart of Los Angeles. His melodic vocals and contemporary sounds are infl uenced by his multicultural upbringing in East LA and Boyle Heights. After the release of his two buzzworthy harmonic EPs, Colour, and Pastel, Katz&ugrave; Oso takes us to another alternative dimension with his debut album, Tm&iacute;. Oso's album is a timeline portal into his hero's journey growing up in his Boyle Heights neighborhood. From the heart and soul he brings to life una historia de amor to escape the current reality and transcend into a melodic universe fi lled with synthesizer and upbeat tempos. Visually, our hero takes on the new alter ego with the Luchador mask, a symbolic representation of his roots and serves as an ode to his Chicano cultura.

Shelby Means & Maya de Vitry
When: Sun, Feb 22, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $20.91
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGES SEATED SHOW LIMITED NUMBER OF PREMIUM SEATING TICKETS AVAILABLE SHELBY MEANS Born in the bluegrass of Kentucky and raised on Wyoming's high plains, Shelby Means is one of the foremost bassists in bluegrass, with nearly two decades of experience in bluegrass, folk, rock, Americana, and country outfits. Now based in Charleston, SC, Means spent a dozen years in Nashville, TN. During that time she performed most notably as a member of the GRAMMY&reg;-nominated all-women bluegrass band Della Mae. She later joined Molly Tuttle & Golden Highway on bass and vocals, earning her first GRAMMY&reg; win for their 2023 album, City of Gold. Means is a driving player with a deep pocket, a singular stage presence, and a magnetic, centered approach to the upright bass. Beyond her work on the instrument, she's also an accomplished songwriter and a heartfelt vocalist whose voice is rooted in tradition while authentically her own. With her debut solo music Means invites listeners to experience the same soulful presence and adventurous spirit she has built her career on. Her singing and playing has been heard across the country and around the world, from NPR's airwaves, the Grand Ole Opry, Bonnaroo, Telluride Bluegrass Festival, and Newport Folk to the U.S. Virgin Islands, Kazakhstan, Australia, and beyond. MAYA DE VITRY Originally from Lancaster, PA, Maya de Vitry is a Nashville-based artist whose music blurs the lines of folk, indie rock, and Americana. An admirer of the dedicated song craft of writers like John Prine, Gillian Welch, and Townes Van Zandt — and of the stirring vocals of artists like Bonnie Raitt and Nina Simone — Maya de Vitry's music invites listeners into a space of openness and connection. After a formative chapter with the roots-Americana trio The Stray Birds, she launched her solo career with the 2019 album Adaptations, earning praise from Rolling Stone Country, NPR Music, and No Depression. Since then, she has built a devoted following, drawn to both her recordings and her powerful live performances. Known for her magnetic voice and hard-won sense of purpose, Maya has toured in North America and Europe, supporting artists like The Wood Brothers, Aoife O'Donovan, John Craigie, and Mighty Poplar. Her songs have also appeared on albums by Molly Tuttle, Lindsay Lou, and Steve Poltz, and her skills as a multi-instrumentalist and harmony singer have contributed to many Nashville recordings. Her fourth full-length release in just six years, The Only Moment, is a 10-track testament to personal reinvention and creative growth. "I'm not just making different music now. It feels like I'm breathing in a different atmosphere," she reflects on her evolution from The Stray Birds to her solo journey. Her sense of liberation is especially apparent in her live shows, which have become a space for spontaneity, peace, and freedom, often woven together with personal stories that connect the songs. "After the show, I just want to know if I've helped you feel more free," Maya says. "That's my unspoken agreement—to myself, my bandmates, and everyone in the audience."

Tyler Ramsey & Carl Broemel – Celestun Tour (Night 1)
When: Fri, Feb 27, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $32.81
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGES FULLY SEATED SHOW LIMITED NUMBER OF PREMIUM SEATING TICKETS AVAILABLE TYLER RAMSEY & CARL BROEMEL Having been friends and occasional touring partners for well over a decade, Asheville, NC-based singer-songwriter-guitarist Tyler Ramsey and My Morning Jacket guitarist Carl Broemel have at long last made their full-length recorded debut with Celestun out January 15. A marvel of interwoven musicianship and testament to the duo's singular camaraderie, the album encapsulates the two veteran guitarist-songwriters' mutual admiration and effortless compatibility as they swap and share nine new songs of dazzling dexterity and grace recorded almost entirely recorded on acoustic guitars. Though their initial objective had been all instrumental, the natural flow of the sessions led the duo to begin incorporating vocal tracks. Music at its most elemental, Celestun sees Carl Broemel and Tyler Ramsey stripping away artifice to unlock and explore deeply personal themes of wanderlust and familial love, of fellowship and communal adventure. "We don't step on each other's toes," says Carl Broemel, "we kind of fit together like puzzle pieces. Maybe that sounds grandiose, but that's how it feels to me when we're playing. We don't even have to talk about it." "We just mesh together in a way that I can't even really explain," says Tyler Ramsey. "I feel like there's some magical connection between our two things, it just makes me smile and satisfies some itch as far as things that I would like to hear on the music that I write. I think he feels the same way about what I do. When I put a part to one of his songs, we both have this feeling like that what exactly what was missing." Previously, Louisville, KY's Carl Broemel has released a series of solo recordings over the past two decades, including 2019's Brokenhearted Jubilee EP in collaboration with drummer Eric Hopper, and recent collaborations with The Futurebirds. Meanwhile, Tyler Ramsey, has earned praise for his former role as songwriter and lead guitarist in Band of Horses as well as an evolving solo body of work that includes 2024's acclaimed New Lost Ages, hailed by Americana UK as "a gentle indie-folk gem."

Darrell Scott + Will Hoge
When: Fri, Mar 6, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $29.75
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGES PARTIALLY SEATED SHOW (guaranteed seating AND standing room only tickets are available at checkout) DARRELL SCOTT Multi-Instrumentalist and Singer-Songwriter Darrell Scott mines and cultivates the everyday moment, taking the rote, menial, mundane, and allowing it to be surreal, ever poignant, and candidly honest, lilting, blooming, and resonating. The words he fosters allow us to make sense of the world, what is at stake here, and our place in it. And ultimately, Darrell knows the sole truth of life is that love is all that matters, that we don't always get it right, but that's the instinctive and requisite circuitous allure of things, why we forever chase it, and why it is held sacred. Darrell Scott comes from a musical family with a father who had him smitten with guitars by the age of 4, alongside a brother who played Jerry Reed style as well. From there, things only ramped up with literature and poetry endeavors while a student at Tufts University, along with playing his way through life. This would never change. After recently touring with Robert Plant and the Zac Brown Band (2 years with each), and producing albums for Malcolm Holcomb and Guy Clark and being named "songwriter of the year" for both ASCAP and NSAI, these days ﬁnd him roaming his Tennessee wilderness acreage hiking along the small river, creating delicious meals with food raised on his property and playing music. He often leads songwriting workshops to help people tell their own truths with their stories, and is as busy as always writing, producing, performing, and just plain fully immersing himself in life. WILL HOGE Will Hoge will release Sweet Misery, the Grammy-nominated artist's 15th studio album on Friday, August 22.On Sweet Misery, Hoge reminds listeners that he isn't afraid to break new ground - all while giving a keen nod to his rock and roll roots with the kind of grace and purpose that only comes with experience - without the baggage of predictability.In Will's own words - "Following the re-recording and re-releases of Carousel and Blackbird On A Lonely Wire I found myself really wanting to make a louder, hooky, rock-n-roll band record again. Good stories, big choruses, shit to make you play it loud and drive fast with the windows down. I was without a band so I enlisted a crew of folks who I love - folks that I believed could really help bring out the bigger ideas in the songs. I hope folks will find some headphones and give it a good, loud listen. Top to bottom, the way albums should be listened to." Will Hoge has a career whose milestones include Number One hits, Grammy nods, major-label record deals, and hard-won independence. Years before Americana music received its own category at the Grammy Awards, Hoge was on the frontlines, helping to pilot and popularize the genre's blend of American roots music. In the current digital era dominated by influencers seeking shortcuts to stardom, Will Hoge proudly treads the scenic route, immersing himself in the journey rather than fixating on the destination.

RATBOYS: When the Sun Explodes Tour 2026
When: Tue, Mar 10, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $27.06
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY RATBOYS Despite its title, Ratboys' new album "Singin' to an Empty Chair" is not defined by what's missing. Rather, it's the beginning of an important dialogue with a close loved one vocalist Julia Steiner finds herself estranged from. The music on the band's sixth studio album – its first for New West Records – fills the space that person left behind with 11 songs showcasing Ratboys at the peak of their powers — twangy, effervescent, as confident as they've ever been, and perhaps more emotionally interrogative than ever before. The four-piece Chicago band followed up 2023's highly acclaimed "The Window" by reconvening with co-producer Chris Walla to begin tracking at a rural Wisconsin cabin before taking the songs to Steve Albini's famed Electrical Audio studios in Chicago and later to Rosebud Studio in Evanston, Illinois. The results veer from bubbly power-pop on "Anywhere" to irresistible post-country on "Penny in the Lake," along with heart-piercing ballads like "Just Want You to Know the Truth" and an exhilarating detour into the extraterrestrial on "Light Night Mountains All That," which Steiner dubs the band's mammoth "wormhole jam." "Singin' to an Empty Chair" also marks the first Ratboys album written since Steiner began therapy, which the singer/lyricist credits for the clarity found across the album's unflinching examinations of relationship and self. Fittingly, as the album begins by extending a hand into the void, it concludes with a scene of serenity – all while weaving candid honesty, humor, chaos, and whimsy along the way. "It's not all doom and gloom," Steiner says. "The experience of making this record definitely gives me hope for whatever happens next." FLORRY For 'Sounds Like…' Florry's sophomore effort as a fully realized band, Francie Medosch and Co. decamped to Drop of Sun studios in the nest of the Blue Ridge Mountains to record with Asheville wunderkind Colin Miller, a critical voice behind the records of MJ Lenderman, Wednesday and Merce Lemon and a powerful songwriter in his own right. Three powerhouse days in late 2023 solidifi ed writing work done by the band earlier that summer in the now defunct Haw Creek compound under Miller's guiding suggestion. The result is a portrait of a ripping band cresting towards the height of their powers, uniquely equipped to capture a wildly loving, barn-burning camcorder clip of a turbulent trip with your best friends, without dipping into nostalgia bait. Lyrically, Medosch's utterances are both careful and excessive, the product of sifting through the rubble of classic good-time media, and fi nding what works for both her and her community to reach the heights of abandon."The Jackass theme song was actually a really big influence on the new album."

When: Fri, Mar 13, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $22.14
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY TWEN Twen is a van-lifeing rock band that emerged onto the east coast music scene in 2017 with their distinct blend of shoegaze, indie rock, and post-punk influences. Though the band was formed in 2016 by lead vocalist Jane Fitzimmons and guitarist Ian Rollins Jones, their emergence post-pandemic has marked the beginning of what is essentially an entirely new project; save for their keeping the name "Twen". This latest chapter is marked by the band booking their own tours, designing and screen printing their own merch, directing and editing their own music videos, and producing and mixing their own albums; all to a degree which would seem impossible to believe, if you didn't know that they also built their own mobile-home from scratch and have been living in it, traversing the North American continent for the past 3 years. The duo-led 5 piece are readying their 3rd LP to be released in 2024, but have already debuted lead single 'SeaStar'; an early 00's throwback to Southern California beach anthems that finds the band further evolving from the coy, shoegaze aesthetics of 'Awestruck' (2019) – to a modern classicism; characterized on their 2nd LP 'One Stop Shop' (2022) by political (yet hopeful) lyrics, indelible hooks and a home-grown sonic mix that rewards the listener with each subsequent spin. With over 350 shows under their belt across North America and Europe, including arena appearances supporting Rainbow Kitten Surprise, Wet Leg, Whitney, Tacocat, & White Reaper, Twen's live show exhibits their all-around relevance as a DIY rock band thriving in the digital age.

Jordana
When: Fri, Mar 27, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $20.91
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY JORDANA Jordana's music has always possessed a unique sense of place. You can hear the stillness of a Kansas bedroom on her 2020 debut Classical Notions… Humid late night New York walks on her double EP Something To Say To You. There's the kaleidoscopic otherworldliness of Summer's Over, her collab release with TV Girl. The unmistakable sunshine of LA on 2024's Lively Premonitions. But on her new semi self-titled project, Jordanaland, the 25-year-old songwriter has officially crafted a place all her own. "Jordanaland is definitely an escape from Americaland. It looks a lot like LA in the videos…for some reason. Weird," muses Jordana. "But it's wherever you want it to be, just close your eyes." Recorded with her friends Charlie Kilgore & Julian Kaufman of offkilter pop group MICHELLE, the EP drops Jordana in her most brightly-colored surroundings yet. Mixed by a pair of Grammy Award winners in Olli Jacobs (Kendrick Lamar, Taylor Swift, beabadoobee) & David Pizzimenti (Ella Mai, Ed Sheeren, Travis Scott), these songs soar with a sonic confidence that has previously only made occasional appearances in her discography. "Pop music was definitely the goal," says Jordana. "Self assured, confident pop. I think the evolution came from becoming more comfortable with my voice, a more established sound, and also looking up to artists who let it all out in that way. I was pretty intimidated at first, because I love MICHELLE. They're powerhouses. So I tried leaning into their energy, and I'm in love with what we made." Of course, if her catalog is any indication, this might simply be a pitstop in a world of pop, but it's a fully realized one. And in Jordanaland, she's running for president. And she's ruling with a very adorable iron fist. At the same time, the EP is littered with picture-perfect love songs & down bad kissoffs. The revved-up jangle pop of "Burning Me Down" and yearning ballad "I Wanna Be" are universal tracks about relationships, while the lithe "Blouse" is about one-sided romantic intimacy and wondering if there's potential for more. Jordana has come a long way from that still Kansas bedroom in 2020, reinventing herself and her surroundings multiple times over. "It does feel liberating," says Jordana, of her reputation as a genre chameleon. "There's no expectation for me, or at least no expectation I'm paying attention to. I get to try new things all the time. It's kind of like going to a theme park and seeing a bunch of your favorite rides and running over to each of them in excitement — each ride offers so many different feelings and experiences, that it's so hard to choose only one to ride for the rest of the day." If you want to find her today, she's riding a dazzling rollercoaster named Jordanaland. Tomorrow? We'll have to wait and see where the journey leads. the booyah! kids The booyah! kids are a three piece indie outfit from NYC. Julian, Aidan, and Emma sing together, telling stories from their bedrooms. A good booyah song should feel like a friend of yours.

Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $20.91
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGES SEATED SHOW LIMITED NUMBER OF PREMIUM SEATING TICKETS AVAILABLE EMILY SCOTT ROBINSON "Colorado singer-songwriter Emily Scott Robinson mixes folk and country with gorgeous, clear-eyed examinations of faith, hope and regret." — NPR On her third album with Oh Boy Records, and her fifth since beginning her career a decade ago, Emily Scott Robinson once again unveils her mastery as a performer and storyteller. With her 2026 release Appalachia — recorded at Dreamland Recording Studios with Grammy-nominated producer Josh Kaufman — Robinson opens herself up to experimentation and sings in her crystal-clear voice about resilience, love, grief and hope. Robinson's talent is no surprise to the music industry — she's now a veteran touring artist, both at home and abroad. Her records Traveling Mercies (2019) and American Siren (2021) each landed high on Rolling Stone's "Best Country and Americana Albums" and Stereogum's "10 Best Country Albums" year-end lists. She's been lauded by the Washington Post, Billboard, American Songwriter and No Depression, and earned the 19th spot on NPR's "100 Best Songs of 2021" with her song "Let 'Em Burn." It was her 2020 release "The Time for Flowers," an anthem of hope recorded at home in the midst of the global pandemic, that caught the attention of Oh Boy Records, the independent label founded by John Prine in 1981. Robinson jumped at the opportunity to join the free-spirited and beloved record label carrying on her hero's legacy. Robinson believes the songs on Appalachia are the best she's ever written — she sings about her grandmother slipping into dementia, a cash-only saloon full of characters, and gratitude for life, despite its hardships. The album features a duet with Grammy winner John Paul White that celebrates the kind of love that comes with scars and age, and a hymn for anyone who's ever failed or fallen short. "There's this thing I do with every record I make," she says. "I knit a prayer into it, and I ask for all these songs to find their way to everyone who needs them. I ask these songs to be of service, to help people find and experience joy."

Della Mae is one such band. The GRAMMY-nominated string band was founded in 2010 and over the next decade and a half they've demonstrated to the roots music world, once and for all, that a band of all women is not, nor has ever been, a mere novelty. They remain at the forefront of the explosion of women instrumentalists and all-women acts in roots music and their impact is striking and measurable – not just in North America, but around the globe. Now 15 years since their origin, Della Mae can boast their strongest lineup yet. Founders Kimber Ludiker and Celia Woodsmith are joined by guitarist and songwriter Avril Smith and vocalist and two-time IBMA Bass Player of the Year Vickie Vaughn. There has never been a band like Della Mae in roots music before, but thanks to Kimber Ludiker, Celia Woodsmith, Avril Smith, Vickie Vaughn – and all of the women who have been part of this band over its long life – we know there will be many more bands, singers, songwriters, and pickers just like Della Mae in the future.

Fust & Merce Lemon w/ Thomas Dolbaum
When: Wed, Apr 15, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $0
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY FUST Fust — the Durham, North Carolina-based band — announce their new album, Big Ugly, out March 7th via Dear Life Records. Big Ugly arrives after the release of 2024's Songs of the Rail––"one of the best alt-country compilations…in a long, long time" (Paste) –– and 2023's standout Genevieve, which unassumingly introduced new listeners to Fust's unmistakable blend of "small-town poetry" (Mojo) with a familiar yet probing "country-tinged folk-rock" (KEXP) that made it "one of the most fun rock records of the year" (Pitchfork).Big Ugly finds Fust taking its "gutsy, blue-collar Americana" (New Commute) further than it has before. Songwriter Aaron Dowdy pushes his obsessions with country-storytelling to more mystifying places, telling stories of Southern life teeming with utopian possibility that arises uniquely from the contradictions for which the south is infamously known. In this way, it is a record that could easily be filed on the record shelf alongside lyric-forward indie or Southern rock, as well as on the bookshelf amongst the throngs of Southern literature hellbent on proving the elegance of grittiness. Big Ugly is also Fust––above all a group of close friends––uncovering a freedom within their sincere form of loose and fried guitar rock, emboldened to deliver both their most intimate songwriting and biggest sound to date.While perhaps "few voices can write a song quite like Aaron Dowdy" (Paste), it is clear upon listening that Big Ugly is an album of fully recognizable voices. One hears in the music the years of interplay between Avery Sullivan (Sluice) on Drums, Justin Morris (Sluice, Weirs) on guitar and vocals, Oliver Child-Lanning (Sluice, Weirs) on bass and vocals, Frank Meadows on piano, John Wallace (Colamo) on guitar and vocals, and Libby Rodenbough (Mipso) on fiddle and vocals. Big Ugly is also the second collaboration with the Asheville-based engineer Alex Farrar, recorded together throughout the summer of 2024 at Drop of Sun Studio. And with the help of many friends including Merce Lemon, Dave Hartley (The War on Drugs), and John James Tourville (The Deslondes), Big Ugly is exactly what one feels it to be: a huge group of people gathered together, stumbling upon songs amidst long days and even longer nights. MERCE LEMON "I could not be alive alone," a longtime family friend says with a smile. "None of us could be alive alone." Within the quiet, cascading corners of Pittsburgh lies a community – nothing short of one large family – that spans zip codes, histories, occupations, and generations, always tumbling inwardly into itself, propped up by steadfast pillars of conviction toward spiritual and emotional mutual aid. The kind of earnest community scaffolding that gets bandied about, wielded as conjecture, particularly in an age of increasing fracture through digital sublimation, is alive and quite well within the universe surrounding Merce Lemon.

The Nude Party
When: Sat, May 2, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $30.75
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY THE NUDE PARTY For The Nude Party, nearly a decade has flown by in the blink of an eye. In that time, the New York-based band has released a pair of well-received albums, an EP, and played countless shows. Prior to the pandemic, the band was really starting to hit its stride. They had a system in place and were spreading their brand of melodic rock to the masses. In fact, they could count Jack White, Arctic Monkeys, and Orville Peck as vocal supporters, which led to support slots for each. Soon, incredible live appearances at Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, Newport Folk Festival, and Shaky Knees became the norm. Over the course of the last two years, The Nude Party decided to produce their new album, Rides On, themselves. With the help of Matthew Horner, The Nude Party had as much fun creating as they ever had at any other point in their career. Their new album includes 14 songs that dabble in electro-pop and stripped-down country. The Nude Party coalesced and embraced the spirit of collaboration. They're excited to begin the next chapter of their career. At a time when it would have been easy to pack it in, the band continues to persevere. TOBACCO CITY Tobacco City is a Chicago-based band that blends cosmic country with a mix of psychedelic rock and honky-tonk soul. Their sound captures the essence of small-town nostalgia while embracing modern-day themes, exploring heartache, longing, and the bittersweet nature of life. With their uplifting energy and authentic songwriting, Tobacco City continues to carve out a unique space in the country-tinged Americana scene.

DANCE WITH THE DEAD + MAGIC SWORD: The Face Off Tour 2026
When: Tue, May 5, 8:00 PM
Where: The Grey Eagle
Price: $34.90
Host: The Grey Eagle
Tags: Live Music, Family
Description: ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY DANCE WITH THE DEAD Drawing inspiration from the dystopian and chilling worlds of cult classic horror and science-fiction films, duo Justin Pointer and Tony Kim have spent over a decade crafting a signature fusion of dark electronic music and metal-fueled synth anthems. Hailing from Irvine, California (USA), DANCE WITH THE DEAD continue to push the boundaries of retro-futuristic soundscapes and cinematic storytelling. The project first emerged on Halloween night in 2013 with their debut release, setting the tone for a career defined by innovation and an ever-evolving sonic identity. Their early work—spanning atmospheric orchestral-leaning pieces and aggressive synth metal—solidified their presence with fan-favorite releases such as Into the Abyss (EP), Near Dark, and crossover hits like "Andromeda" and "Invader." Their influence within the synthwave world earned them a featured appearance in the acclaimed documentary The Rise of the Synths, narrated by filmmaker John Carpenter. DANCE WITH THE DEAD's distinctive sound merges analog synth textures with the raw grit of early heavy metal guitars—a combination shaped by influences such as Hans Zimmer, Justice, Daft Punk, The Misfits, White Zombie, Ozzy Osbourne, Alice Cooper, Kavinsky, Metallica, and John Carpenter. Their catalog has featured notable collaborations as well, including guest contributions from John Carpenter and Cody Carpenter (Driven to Madness), as well as Nick Hipa and professional skateboarder Elliot Sloan (Loved to Death). MAGIC SWORD Magic Sword is an ageless tale of good and evil told through an ever expanding graphic novel with each volume accompanied by an original, synth-heavy soundtrack as well as immersive live performances. With the three mediums intertwined from conception, together they create an epic experience for those bold enough to bear witness and come away with a deeper understanding of the ultimate hero's journey. Armed with a musical and visual aesthetic that has its roots unabashedly buried deep in the golden era of '70s and '80s fantasy and sci-fi, Magic Sword's followers are called to another plane of existence where the struggle between light and shadow becomes all too real. The multiverse has aligned to bring the people of the land together for the birth of their album Endless, followed by a tour of the realm searching for the greater good. MEGAN MCDUFFEE Megan McDuffee is a Seattle-based award-winning music producer, composer, and recording artist. She grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area of California, and always had something musical going on, from taking private lessons to 11 years of participating in world-traveling choirs. Megan graduated from the University of California Santa Cruz with a Bachelor of Arts in Film Scoring and a minor in Electronic Music. With a desire to further her education, she went on to the Berklee College of Music, earning a Master's Certificate in Orchestration for Film and TV. By day Megan scores video games, TV shows, and movie trailers, and by night she produces dark, moody, edgy electronica and rock that rides the line between dreams and nightmares.
