    "description": "ALL AGES FULLY SEATED SHOW LIMITED NUMBER OF PREMIUM SEATING TICKETS AVAILABLE MIKE COOLEY Mike Cooley is an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter, best known as a member of the Southern rock band Drive-By Truckers. The Alabama musical style blends elements of rock, country, and Americana, and he is recognized for his sharp, evocative lyrics and distinctive guitar work. As one of the band's primary songwriters, Cooley has written numerous iconic tracks for Drive-By Truckers, with his songs often exploring themes of personal introspection, Southern identity, and social commentary. Alongside bandmate Patterson Hood, Cooley has been a driving force behind the band's evolution since their formation in the late 1990s, contributing to their gritty, honest sound and critical success. In addition to his work with the band, Cooley has pursued a solo career, releasing his debut solo album The Fool on Every Corner in December 2012. The album showcases his storytelling prowess and ability to create poignant, introspective songs with a more stripped-down, intimate sound compared to his work with Drive-By Truckers. Known for his wit and keen observational style, Cooley's solo work highlights his versatility as an artist, cementing his place as an influential figure in contemporary American roots music.",

    "description": "ALL AGES PARTIALLY SEATED SHOW (please note seated VS standing room only options at checkout) EILEN JEWELL Hailed by American Songwriter as \"one of America's most intriguing, creative, and idiosyncratic voices,\" Eilen Jewell rises from the ashes on her captivating new album, Get Behind The Wheel, picking up the pieces of her shattered world and finding new purpose and meaning after watching her marriage, her band, and what felt like her entire career fall apart in a series of spectacular, heartbreaking implosions. Co-produced by multi-instrumental wizard Will Kimbrough (Todd Snider, Hayes Carll), the collection pushes the acclaimed singer and songwriter's trademark blend of vintage roots-noir into more psychedelic territory, with spacious, cinematic arrangements complementing her revelatory explorations of grief, loss, resilience, and redemption. An Idaho native, Jewell built her career the old fashioned way, touring relentlessly with the kind of undeniable live show that converts the uninitiated into instant acolytes. Over the course of nine albums, she's crisscrossed the globe countless times and shared bills with the likes of Lucinda Williams, Loretta Lynn, Mavis Staples, Wanda Jackson, George Jones, and Emmylou Harris. Rolling Stone lauded Jewell's \"clever writing,\" while NPR declared that she has a \"sweet and clear voice with a killer instinct lurking beneath the shiny surface,\" and The Washington Post mused that \"if Neko Case, Madeleine Peyroux and Billie Holiday had a baby girl who grew up to front a rockabilly band, she'd probably sound a lot like Eilen Jewell.\"",

In the making of their new album, Mind, Man, Medicine, Alabama-bred siblings Laura Rogers and Lydia Slagle found their songwriting transformed by a newfound sense of self-reliance and equanimity, threading their lyrics with hard-won insight into the complexities of motherhood, commitment, compassion, and self-preservation in an endlessly chaotic world. Centered on a kaleidoscopic sound that boldly blurs the edges of country-folk, the duo's fifth full-length ultimately confronts many of modern life's harshest challenges while leading the listener toward a more open-hearted state of mind. The follow-up to Saturn Return—their 2020 Grammy-nominated LP co-produced by Brandi Carlisle and lavishly praised by the likes of Rolling Stone—Mind, Man, Medicine finds The Secret Sisters co-producing alongside Ben Tanner (Alabama Shakes, St. Paul & the Broken Bones) and John Paul White (formerly of Grammy-winning duo the Civil Wars). \"On Saturn Return we'd gotten much more confident as far as directing the sound of the record and knowing how to capture our voices in the most honest way, so it felt like the right time for our first foray into production,\" says Rogers. The latest in a series of critically lauded releases, the album came to life at FAME Studios (the historic spot in their hometown of Muscle Shoals) and at Sun Drop Sound in nearby Florence, with contributions from such esteemed musicians as Alabama Shakes bassist Zac Cockrell and legendary multi-instrumentalist Larry Campbell (Paul Simon, Willie Nelson, Levon Helm). Looking back on the creation of Mind, Man, Medicine, The Secret Sisters reveal that the immense support of their fans played a major role in their willingness to tread previously uncharted emotional terrain. \"I remember playing a show last fall and expressing my gratitude to the crowd that they'd come out to see us, because as mothers of young children we now understand how challenging that can be,\" says Rogers. \"Later on that night a woman came up to us with her daughter and husband and said something like, 'I know it's so hard to leave your babies—but you leaving your babies at home for a little while is what makes moments like this happen for other families.' It was so gratifying to hear that, and reminded me of the whole purpose behind the music that we make: it's to benefit the hearts of other people, anyone who needs that healing or validation or connection, or even just the space to cry. That's why we keep doing this.\" CALEB ELLIOTT",

    "description": "ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY YARN You might expect a band that calls itself Yarn to, naturally, tend to spin a yarn or two. \"That's what we do, we tell stories, live and in the studio, truth and fiction\",singer/songwriter Blake Christiana insists. \"We don't always opt for consistency. There's a different vibe onstage from what comes through in our recordings. There's a difference in every show as well, you never know what you're going to get.\" Yarn's ability to persevere ought to come as no great surprise, especially for a band that spent two years honing their chops during a Monday night residency at the famed Kenny's Castaway in New York's Greenwich Village. In effect, it allowed them to rehearse onstage, mostly in front of audiences that often ranged in size from five to a hundred people on any given night. 10 studio albums followed -- Yarn (2007), Empty Pockets (2008), Leftovers Part One (2009), Come On In (2010), Leftovers Part 2 (2011), Almost Home (2012), Shine the Light On (2013), This Is The Year (2016), and Lucky 13 parts 1 & 2 (2019). The band then took to the road, playing upwards of 170 shows a year and sharing stages with such superstars as Dwight Yoakam, Charlie Daniels, Railroad Earth, Marty Stuart, Allison Krauss, Leon Russell, Jim Lauderdale, Leftover Salmon, Amos Lee, The Lumineers and many more. They've driven nonstop, made countless radio station appearances, driven broken-down RVs and watched as their van caught fire. They've paid their dues and then some, looking forward even as they were forced to glance behind. It's proof positive that the Brooklyn and Raleigh based band have made their mark, and in dealing with their emotions, scars and circumstances, they find themselves in a position to share those experiences with others who have juggled similar sentiments CRUZ CONTRERAS Raised between the rugged lines of Tennessee and the long shadows of Michigan, Cruz Contreras has spent nearly thirty years forging his path through the Americana musical landscape. He's a multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, bandleader, producer, and storyteller whose voice cuts through noise like a well-honed blade. He got his start at 15, playing guitar behind his younger brother Billy Contreras at fiddle competitions—long before Billy became a world-renowned fiddler, known for his work with George Jones, Sierra Ferrell, Oliver Anthony and Ricky Skaggs. But it was a moment in 1993 that sealed Cruz's fate: finding himself in a room with the Father of Bluegrass, Bill Monroe. That room, that sound, that presence—it lit a fire that's never gone out. Now touring behind his debut solo album Cosmico, Cruz is joined once more by a band of road-tested companions under the name Cruz Contreras and The Black Lillies. Together, they bring with them a catalog of songs that stretch across time — from the familiar past to the hopeful unknown.",

Produced by rock legend Ron St. Germain, Rosemary represents a culmination of years of performing and songwriting and helped forge a special connection with fans. Their signature pop rock LP holds some of the band's best-known and loved songs Rosemary helped the Fence become one of the biggest regional draws of that time – roaming the college circuit, always returning to their home base, indie rock Mecca Chapel Hill, NC. The band's college town jangle had a touch of soul and a youthful romanticism decidedly out of step with '90s nihilism. Follow-up LPs Outside In and Living Room Scene reflected the sonic influence of alternative rock while retaining their dedication to harmony and songcraft. Tours across the U.S. and Europe supporting X, Hootie & The Blowfish, and The Black Crowes followed. The band unofficially broke up in 1995; however, since 2000, Dillon Fence has reunited regularly to play shows for their appreciative fans and celebrate music that defines a special time for the band and the fans. Celebrate the 35th anniversary of Rosemary and get into the holiday spirit with Dillon Fence this December!

His latest record, Love Is Enough, is a love letter to connection, chaos, and keeping your heart open in a world gone sideways.",

    "description": "ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY THE CHEEKSTERS The Cheeksters were formed in 1990 soon after Mark and Shannon met by chance on a train in London, England. Mark hails from the UK, while Shannon was born and raised in Tennessee. They started performing music together as a duo with Mark on guitar and vocals and Shannon playing bass guitar. They soon released their debut album \" Stranger Things Have Happened \" in 1992, followed by \" Hey, What's Your Style ? \" in 1994. The couple relocated to Nashville in 1996 and began working with producer Brent Little at his all analog studio Cream Puff Recorders. So far they have recorded four critically acclaimed albums at Cream Puff - \" Skating On The Cusp \" ( 1999 ) , \" Nineteen Sixty Five \" ( 2005 ) , \" Movers and Shakers \" ( 2007 ) , \" The Golden Birds \" ( 2011 ) – and are currently hard at work on a new record. Over the years The Cheeksters have performed extensively in the SouthEast US, as well as showcasing their talents in NYC and London. Their songs have been recently placed with the NFL and Coca-Cola for commercial use, gaining them wide exposure and new fans. The Cheeksters combine the best of what made music great in the 1960's with a winning, fresh pop approach that delights audiences. In the studio the group has produced six albums of timeless, tuneful, terrific pop that has real staying power. Onstage the versatile four-piece band turns out its straightforward catchy pop confections, bringing to mind a swirling variety of influences : Memphis soul, Carnaby Street pop, swampy rhythm and blues, and more. They somehow manage to channel Burt Bacharach / Hal David pop, Dusty Springfield's diva soul, T-Rex's manic boogie and the pomp of David Bowie often in the same song without sounding derivative. The current line-up has performed together for the past seven years and is made up of Mark Casson ( vocals, guitar, piano ) , Shannon Hines Casson ( vocals, bass guitar ) , Jay Moye ( piano, guitar ) and Mike Baker ( drums ). DOSS CHURCH AND THE UNHOLY NOISE Doss Church & the Unholy Noise is an Asheville-based Americana Rock & Roll band that plays a mix of originals written by singer/songwriter Doss Church, along with a wide range of crowd-pleasing cover songs. Doss Church is a seasoned songwriter who fuses soulful, heartfelt vocals with warm, expressive acoustic guitar. His deeply storied, personal lyrics are filled with hope found and love lost. The Unholy Noise combines Americana, Country, and Folk Rock influences that range from the 60's to today and delivers a sound that feels both new and old at the same time. The honest songwriting, veteran musicianship, and electric stage presence of the entire group make for a truly moving live performance.",

At the core of Electro Lust beats the hearts of Grammy Award-winning artists from Asheville, NC's musical scene - Yo Mama's Big Fat Booty Band, The Fritz, Empire Strikes Brass, & Marcus King Band.

Tix on sale now, get 'em while they're hot (get it? hot? cause it's a summer thing?). The Get Right Band is a psychedelic indie rock group committed to relentlessly following their muses to honest self-expression, to whatever excites them and pushes them into unexplored territory, to capturing some version of truth. American Songwriter writes that the Asheville, NC based group, \"filters 60's/70's psychedelia and 90's alternative rock through a modern lens–as if Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and Nirvana co-wrote an album produced by Danger Mouse and Dan Auerbach.\" The Get Right Band formed in 2011, built around the musical brotherhood that guitarist/singer/songwriter Silas Durocher and bassist Jesse Gentry have formed playing music together since middle school. Durocher, who is a trained composer and has been commissioned to write for symphonies and chamber groups, has guitar chops that can soothe or rage, with a charismatic swagger as frontman and singer. Gentry's virtuosic bass playing \"catapults from elastic to nasty\" (The Mountain Xpress). Completing the team is drummer extraordinaire Jaze Uries, who is also a singer, songwriter, producer, photographer, and DJ, and keys legend Chuck Lichtenberger, whose incredible playing has been a staple of the Asheville music scene for years. GRB has defined their sound through constant evolution, building to the hook-driven, synth-heavy pop/rock/psych band they are today. The Huffington Post writes, \"their songs are infectious and take you immediately to a place. The lyrics are smart and bear weight.\" SUPATIGHT",

Rooted in the Detroit area, Ava's story is shaped by a blend of grit and grace. Her father was raised on Detroit's iconic 8 Mile and built a successful career as a real estate executive, while her mother poured her heart into raising their children with unwavering love, faith, and strength after a career as an executive in the automotive industry. That balance of resilience and refinement shows up in Ava's music, where classic storytelling meets contemporary authenticity.A senior at Belmont University majoring in Songwriting, Ava graduates this year with distinction—not only for her talent but for breaking new ground. She is the very first student chosen by Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee Ashley Gorley to serve as his apprentice in a newly launched mentorship program, signaling early recognition of Ava's potential to shape the next chapter of country music.Raised on a soundtrack of Frank Sinatra and Dolly Parton, Ava developed an ear for melody and a voice that sounds as though it was plucked from a bygone era. Her vocals are rich, emotional, and unmistakably country—rooted in tradition but carried by fresh perspective. Faith-driven and deeply connected to her close-knit family, Ava is a twin and big sister, roles that have shaped her grounded outlook and storytelling voice.Her debut single, \"Georgia Heat,\" written entirely by Ava, was quickly recognized by curators and added to Spotify's Fresh Finds Country and Apple Music's Country Risers playlists—two platforms known for spotlighting the genre's next generation. Her upcoming single, \"What About Yours,\" co-written with breakout hitmaker Johnny Clawson, is poised to further solidify her arrival.Whether writing about heartbreak, home, or hope, Ava brings a rare sincerity to everything she does. With a debut EP on the horizon and support from some of the industry's most trusted names, she's not just chasing country music dreams—she's living them, one honest lyric at a time.",

For some, there comes a moment when Robert Zimmerman becomes Bob Dylan, when Reginald Dwight becomes Elton John, when David Robert Jones becomes David Bowie, when Ali Ibrahim becomes Ali Farka- it's a moment, when such an artist leaves behind the comforts of history in search of boundless expression- a moment when they metaphorically move out of their home, stepping into the unknown, and surrendering to the wild embrace of their muse. This chapter of my journey mirrors that kind of transformation. My new band, The Jet Stone Conspiracy, is the culmination of my rebirth- It's a surrender to the currents of free expression- an invitation to explore new realms of sound, movement, and poetry. The first mission of this new chapter is to come visit you with my band and share the songs from Tales of America, Tales of Isolation, and Spanish Villager No:3– all brought to life for the first time in a full-band setting. This will be my first time touring with a band– an invitation to experience with you the music that has led us to this point, in an expanded and dynamic form, and to hear the new material I'm exploring for the upcoming debut release of The Jet Stone Conspiracy. Much love,JS Ondara Announces Special Winter Run: Introducing His New Band Project — The Jet Stone Conspiracy Some transmissions don't come through a radio. They arrive in a dream, unannounced, and crystal clear. Born in Nairobi and reborn in America, J.S. (Jet Stone) Ondara's path has always been one of restless searching — from discovering Bob Dylan in a teenage dispute to teaching himself guitar after moving to Minneapolis alone, eventually earning a Grammy nomination for his debut album Tales of America and sharing stages with Neil Young, The Lumineers, and Lindsey Buckingham. After years of quiet searching and restless wandering, Ondara returns to the stage transformed. Following his Rebirth Tour, he stepped away from the spotlight, journeying across continents in pursuit of new personal and creative horizons. From that search, he emerges as Jet Stone — his true name — stepping into a new chapter with his new band project, The Jet Stone Conspiracy. This fall, Ondara will embark on the first full-band tour of his career. This special run is more than just a series of concerts; it's an invitation into a world rebuilt from the ground up. A chance to witness a rare moment of transformation in real time. Each night, Ondara, now performing as Jet Stone, will breathe new life into beloved songs from his catalog while offering a first look at new material from his upcoming debut as The Jet Stone Conspiracy. For longtime fans, it's an opportunity to reconnect with the music that started it all — now charged with a fresh, urgent energy. For new listeners, it's an entry point into an evolving story of transformation, reinvention, and artistic freedom.",

    "description": "ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY RUSTON KELLY Since making his debut with 2018's Dying Star, Ruston Kelly has built a catalog of songs that search for transcendence in the most devastating and demanding of experiences: addiction, the strenuous work of self-evolution, the fallout of broken relationships. But in the writing of his latest album, the South Carolina-born artist found himself in unfamiliar emotional territory—a state of sustained joy and inner peace, brought on by a spiritual breakthrough and the dawning of a new love. Brimming with the grit and depth that's always defined his output, Pale, Through the Window ultimately affirms Kelly as one of modern music's most astute observers of the human heart and spirit. The follow-up to The Weakness—a 2023 release that earned major acclaim from the likes of Rolling Stone, The New York Times, NPR and led to his appearance on \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\"—Pale, Through the Window finds Kelly reuniting with his longtime collaborator Jarrad K, who also helmed production on Dying Star and 2020's Shape & Destroy. The first body of work he's recorded with his longtime touring band, the album centers on a singular sonic palette that often merges synth with pedal-steel guitar while fully embracing Kelly's ardent love of classic pop-punk and emo—ultimately bringing a raw and potent energy to his soul-searching songwriting. Over the course of Pale, Through the Window's 13 songs, Kelly offers up everything from the somber rumination of the LP's title track and the rueful longing of \"Twisted Root\" (an intimate look at his history with addiction) to the radiant open-heartedness of love songs like \"Waiting to Love You\" and \"Wayside\" (a euphoric but unvarnished portrait of love against the backdrop of a world in flames). And in sharing such an all-embracing account of his journey to acceptance and peace, he aspires to provide others with the courage to persevere through their own personal chaos. \"If someone's struggling with doubt or hopelessness because of the state of the world or their relationship with God or with themselves, I hope this record leaves them with the sense that it can be okay and that love truly is the most powerful force we have available to us,\" says Kelly. \"I also hope they feel at least a sliver of the freedom and joy I felt in writing these songs—even if they're just having a good time bobbing their head to 'Waiting to Love You,' I want everyone to be reminded that the world can be a joyful place.\" verygently verygently is the collective force of three established Nashville singer-songwriters—Drew Erwin, Joey Hendricks, and Tristan Bushman—who came together in early 2024.

Known for his raw, storytelling lyrics, gravelly voice, and unapologetic independence, Eaglesmith has become a cult hero to fans of Americana, folk, and country music. Born in rural Ontario in 1957, he ran away from home at 15, hopping freight trains and living a nomadic life that would later fuel the vivid, working-class narratives in his songs. With a career spanning more than 25 albums, Eaglesmith has earned a reputation as a prolific and uncompromising artist. His songs, often laced with wit, heartbreak, and a touch of rebellion, have been covered by legends like Toby Keith, Alan Jackson, Miranda Lambert and countless more. Tracks like \"Time to Get a Gun\" and \"Freight Train\" have become anthems for the disenfranchised, while his live performances- equal parts rock show and revival meeting- have cemented his status as a must-see act. Eaglesmith, along with his multi-instrumental wife, Tif Ginn, have teamed up with a new band, The Velvet Frogs, injecting fresh energy into their timeless sound. The Velvet Frogs bring a dynamic, genre-blurring edge to Eaglesmith's music, blending his signature rootsy grit with psychedelic undertones and a dash of rock 'n' roll swagger. Together, they're reimagining his classic tunes and introducing new material that proves Eaglesmith is as vital and inventive as ever. No longer a road warrior, Eaglesmith is now only playing select and curated dates, as a duo with Tif Ginn, as well as with The Velvet Frogs. He continues to push boundaries, defy expectations, and remind us why he's one of the most enduring and enigmatic figures in modern music. Whether you're a longtime devotee or a newcomer to his world, one things for sure: Fred Eaglesmith is still writing his story, one unforgettable song at a time.",

    "description": "ALL AGESPARTIALLY SEATED SHOW (guaranteed seating AND standing room only tickets are available at checkout) CHATHAM COUNTY LINE Launched a little more than twenty years ago in Raleigh, North Carolina, Chatham County Line built a devoted local following on the strength of their genre-bending live show—an intoxicating blend of bluegrass, folk, country, and rock and roll—before breaking out internationally with their 2003 self-titled debut. In the years to come, the band would go on to release eight more critically acclaimed studio albums, top the Billboard Bluegrass Chart four times, collaborate with the likes of Judy Collins, Sharon Van Etten, and Norwegian star Jonas Fjeld, earn two gold records in Norway (where they were also twice nominated for the Spellemannprisen, Norway's equivalent of a Grammy), and share bills with everyone from Guy Clark and Lyle Lovett to Steve Martin & Martin Short and The Avett Brothers. NPR hailed the group as \"a bridge between bluegrass traditions and a fresh interpretation of those influences,\" while Uncut lauded their \"powerful melodies and gorgeous harmonies,\" and Pitchfork dubbed their music \"timeless.\" The band's latest release, Hiyo, marks the band's first release since the departure of their longtime banjo player and serves as something of a reintroduction to the roots stalwarts, complete with new sounds, new collaborators, and a whole new lease on life. Recorded at Asheville's Echo Mountain studio with co-producer/engineer Rachael Moore (Kacey Musgraves, Robert Plant and Alison Krauss), the collection finds the trio—Dave Wilson (lead singer/guitarist), John Teer (fiddle/mandolin) and Greg Readling (bass/pedal steel), embracing change at every turn, experimenting with fresh sonic palettes and innovative approaches to their core instrumentation. The songwriting remains classic Chatham County Line here—rich, evocative tales of love and heartbreak, joy and sorrow, righteousness and revenge—but the settings have evolved to incorporate synthesizers, drum machines, and more electric guitar and percussion than ever before. Given the group's string band roots and decades spent singing around a single microphone, the results are nothing short of revelatory, taking an enduring sound and injecting it with a thrilling new spirit of discovery and vitality.",

In May of 2023, The Cody Sisters released their self-titled EP marking a new beginning for the band. It is their first release since parting ways with their former image of \"young girls in a family band\" and it portrays a sense of maturity and musical understanding that reveals a new dimension to their artistic expression. They set out to explore new sounds and styles while still holding true to their bluegrass roots, and they have done just that. This new music is an invitation to connect, to feel, and to journey together through original lyrics and captivating instrumental arrangements.

    "title": "Friendship w/ Natalie Jane Hill",
    "description": "ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY FRIENDSHIP Music for sleeping and waking, walking and driving, hunting and fishing, for loitering outside a roadhouse on the haunted tundra. Okay in elevators, not great for dinner. On Caveman Wakes Up Friendship's new album and second for Merge Records, the band's historically capacious definition of country music grows wider still. Shambolic guitars are offset by flute pads, bleary poetry is set against a Motown rhythm section, a song about Jerry Garcia and First Lady Betty Ford fades out with a drum solo, like if Talk Talk came from a dingy Philadelphia basement, and was fronted by James Tate. Songwriter Dan Wriggins' ragged baritone cuts through eleven murky, swirling country-rock songs with profound lyrical substance and sincerity. Like an alarm clock incorporated into the edge of a dream, Caveman Wakes Up belongs equally to the conscious and subconscious mind, fraught with background, steeped in reference and experimentation, delivered casually and as a dire warning, dedicated, above all, to music's creative soul. Over the years, dedication has paid off. Friendship has become a kind of reverse supergroup, wherein the band itself and each individual member is located centrally in an increasingly prominent scene of young folk and country musicians and songwriters. Drummer Michael Cormier O'Leary leads the instrumental collective Hour and, along with bassist Jon Samuels, run Dear Life Records, home to friends and peers who count Friendship as a major influence, including MJ Lenderman, Florry, and Fust. (Samuels also plays lead guitar in MJ Lenderman and the Wind). Guitarist Peter Gill's band 2nd Grade records prolifically. Wriggins began writing the songs of Caveman Wakes Up on a downtuned classical guitar of Lenderman's, and finished on a barely-tuned piano in an apartment he shared with Sadurn's G DeGroot. In the summer of 2023, Wriggins had just left the Iowa Writers' Workshop, where his love for poetry and mistrust for the academic poetry world grew in tandem. A relationship fell apart, and Wriggins crashed for several weeks at Lenderman's and Wednesday's Karly Hartzman's home in North Carolina, where he recorded the first demos of \"Resident Evil,\" \"All Over the World,\" and \"Love Vape.\" Wriggins returned to Philadelphia, and the band got to work on new ideas, finally tracking the album in five days with engineer Jeff Ziegler (Mary Lattimore, War on Drugs). NATALIE JANE HILL Natalie Jane Hill's new record, Hopeful Woman, is composed of slender songs, life-sized, in which humans endeavor to reconcile themselves to wildernesses and cities; rearrange their rooms and open windows to be closer to the world outside and its choruses of frogs and crickets; attempt and fail to reach one another across a kitchen table; weather natural disaster. If something we might deign to call self-discovery emerges over the course of these narratives, it owes in no small part to the scale of their scenes, to the modesty of their ambitions, in which tumult and adaptation and growth are metabolized through a body's gentle actions and reactions, its moments of quietude and observation and reflection. \"Into the current of life I will fly,\" Hill sings on Oranges, a song that would serve her well as a mission statement. \"Changing and loving and growing and trying.\"",

On his ninth album, The Dreamin' Kind, the Nashville-based songwriter plugs in his electric guitar and dives headfirst into big-hearted, 1970s-style rock & roll. Produced by Greta Van Fleet's Sam F. Kiszka, the record pairs power chords and soaring hooks with the vulnerable storytelling that's long defined Slim's work. \"It felt like I was blowing some old shit up so I could plant some new flowers,\" he says. \"I love folk music, but rock & roll tickles the same part of my soul. I wanted to explore that.\" The collaboration began after Slim opened for Greta Van Fleet, leading to loose, inspired sessions with Kiszka and drummer Danny Wagner. Together they built songs that move from the propulsive rush of \"Rock N Roll\" and the swagger of \"Haunted Man\" to the tender sweep of \"Dream Come True\" and \"Stealin' Time.\" Recorded over a year in Nashville, The Dreamin' Kind bridges Slim's rootsy past with a louder, more expansive present. It's a record of freedom and discovery, equally at home in rock clubs and around campfires — proof that Langhorne Slim, ever the dreamer, still finds new ground to break with every song.",

    "description": "ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY AMELIA DAY Amelia Day is a musical jack-of-all-trades. Standing at the intersection of folk, rock, and pop, Day blends heartfelt storytelling, raw delivery, and unforgettable melodies into music that feels both fresh and familiar — like rediscovering an old favorite. A self-described writer before anything else, her perceptive lyricism extends far beyond her 23 years, with lines reminiscent of songwriting greats like Joni Mitchell and Paul Simon. As the Spokesman-Review notes, Day has a signature style that features \"wordplay, double-meanings and rhythmic variations,\" with themes ranging from journeying into adulthood to climate change. Many of Day's songs are also shaped by her intimate relationships, where her queerness and candor take center stage. Day's upcoming EP EGO TRIP is her most personal project yet. Lead single \"Lady Los Angeles\" traces the sting of betrayal after discovering infidelity, while the rest of the EP takes listeners on an intimate journey through her grieving process. \"The character of 'Lady Los Angeles' is representative of my ex's obsession with attention and fame at all costs and my own fear of being seduced by those same temptations,\" Day explains. \"It felt like she was having an affair, not only with another person, but with the often-self-aggrandizing culture of Los Angeles itself.\" Born and raised in the small town of Sumner, Washington — the self-proclaimed \"Rhubarb Pie Capital of the World\" — Day has been drawn to music-making since she could walk. \"I had no idea what I was doing, but I had a toy ukulele and drum, and my parents had an upright piano that I would mess around on,\" she recalls. \"I could spend hours just playing around on the keys, making up little songs, which my piano teacher recognized and encouraged.\" By middle school, Day was already writing her own songs \"about myself and my (very angsty) preteen feelings.\" Once Day got to college, she began performing her originals publicly, though not without roadblocks. \"I had horrible stage fright up until mid-college,\" she admits. Starting with farmers markets and local restaurants, Day gradually built up the confidence and the following that would lead to sold-out shows in Seattle, Boston, and D.C., as well as festival appearances at Bumbershoot (\"one of my favorite sets I've ever played…there was a line of people outside waiting to get in!\"), Capitol Hill Block Party, Folklife Festival, and Seattle PrideFest — all on her own. \"I'm proud of getting to this point as an artist completely solo,\" Day says. Already boasting over a million streams on a number of songs, Amelia Day continues to prove herself as both a songwriter and performer, emerging as a voice destined to resonate for years to come.",

    "description": "- ALL AGES - STANDING ROOM ONLY TRAIN SONGZ: AN EVENING WITH THE ASHEVILLE MOUNTAIN BOYS By their name, you know where they are from, and by their sound, you know what they are about. The Asheville Mountain Boys are on a mission to capture not just the style but the spirit of traditional bluegrass. Asheville, NC has long been known for great music and its roots in bluegrass go back to the founding of the genre (Bill Monroe's first broadcast performance as the Bluegrass Boys was at Asheville radio station WWNC in 1938) A group that firmly stakes its claim to the tradition of the music from the area, The Asheville Mountain Boys spring onto the scene with a thought,\" What happened to bluegrass?\" It's not a disparaging one that condemns current styles in the genre but rather asks, \"Why do we love this music in the first place\" and answers with an approach that is true to the originators of the genre in the sense of both style and philosophy. Train Songz started as an Instagram meme page. As its audience grew, The Conductor and his trusty engineer Promontory Paul derailed the social media train and took their audience offline with a print fanzine. The first issue of Train Songz was released in January 2024, six months after the meme page got its start, and the zine-team has released quarterly issues since. This show, featuring traditional bluegrass from the Asheville Mountain Boys, will be a launch party for the ninth issue of Train Songz—and the first of 2026, our third year in publication. On top of the music, we'll inject the evening with some Train Songz sensibilities and welcome some friends who dye, bootleg, and peddle other such wares one might find \"on lot.\" We'll have offline-exclusive merchandise and zines, as well!

It contains timbres and textures no other instrument can replicate, but most importantly, itʼs immensely powerful: One voice can spark an uprising, but many voices in unison create a movement. Nya Gazelle Brown, Sabrina Cunningham, and Piya Malik, the three women who front NYC punk-chic, discodelic band Say She She, understand how to wield such power. They soar above irresistible grooves, locking together in gorgeous three-part harmonies that cleverly disguise the feeling of righteous rebellion permeating their music. Theirs is a multi-pronged call to action: Move your body, expand your mind, and recognize your strength. Say She She, whose name pays homage to Nile Rodgers, made Cut & Rewind, their third record, almost immediately after wrapping the tours supporting 2023ʼs Silver. The bandʼs trajectory has skyrocketed over the past few years, earning praise from The Guardian, the LA Times, MOJO, and NPR, and touring with Thee Sacred Souls. They have performed at venues like the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles and the Roundhouse in London, as well as festivals including Glastonbury, Austin City Limits, and Pickathon. Theyʼve long mined the sounds of the '70s and '80s, citing Minnie Riperton, Rotary Connection, Liquid Liquid, and ESG as influences. Cut & Rewind expands their scope, incorporating elements of Lonnie Liston Smith and the Lijadu Sisters into their sonic palette while channeling the spirit of contemporaries like Lambrini Girls and Amyl and the Sniffers. It all combines into a psychedelic soundscape of pulsing disco beats, astral whistle tones, and earwormy melodies. Katz&ugrave; Oso Katz&ugrave; Oso is a Chicano artist born and raised in the heart of Los Angeles. His melodic vocals and contemporary sounds are infl uenced by his multicultural upbringing in East LA and Boyle Heights. After the release of his two buzzworthy harmonic EPs, Colour, and Pastel, Katz&ugrave; Oso takes us to another alternative dimension with his debut album, Tm&iacute;. Oso's album is a timeline portal into his hero's journey growing up in his Boyle Heights neighborhood. From the heart and soul he brings to life una historia de amor to escape the current reality and transcend into a melodic universe fi lled with synthesizer and upbeat tempos. Visually, our hero takes on the new alter ego with the Luchador mask, a symbolic representation of his roots and serves as an ode to his Chicano cultura.",

    "description": "ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY JAKE XERXES FUSSELL Reared in Georgia and now settled in North Carolina, Jake Xerxes Fussell has established himself as a devoted listener and contemplative interpreter of a vast array of so-called folk songs, lovingly sourced from a personal store of favorites. On his latest album, When I'm Called—his first LP for Fat Possum, and his first as a parent—Fussell returns to a well of music that holds lifelong sentimental meaning, loosely contemplating the passage of time and the procession of life's unexpected offerings. The album was produced by James Elkington and mixed by Tucker Martine. In addition to Elkington, it features the playing of Ben Whiteley (The Weather Station), Joe Westerlund (Bon Iver, Califone), and others. Blake Mills contributes guitars on several tracks. Joan Shelley and Robin Holcomb provide backing vocals. \"…Fussell is the rare contemporary to approach folk in its pure form, shunning self-penned compositions about bummer relationships to concentrate on material handed down from bygone, hardened times.\" – The New Yorker \"(Fussell) is one of the great magpies of American song, collecting forgotten, tarnished gems with a folklorist's zeal… his renditions aren't so much cover versions as composites…\" – The Guardian \"…maybe the leading interpreter of American folk music right now.\" – Ann Powers, NPR DOUGIE POOLE Dougie Poole is a musician and songwriter living in Los Angeles. Coming of age in Providence, Rhode Island's DIY scene in the early 2010's, he dabbled in heavier and more experimental music before maturing into a country auteur. On The Rainbow Wheel of Death, Poole's 3rd release via Wharf Cat Records, he breathes new life into country music, retaining the acclaimed elements of his previous work — drum machines, acoustic guitars, synthesizers, and his deep-set voice — while pushing toward something warm, organic, and prismatic.",

    "description": "ALL AGES SEATED SHOW LIMITED NUMBER OF PREMIUM SEATING TICKETS AVAILABLE SHELBY MEANS Born in the bluegrass of Kentucky and raised on Wyoming's high plains, Shelby Means is one of the foremost bassists in bluegrass, with nearly two decades of experience in bluegrass, folk, rock, Americana, and country outfits. Now based in Charleston, SC, Means spent a dozen years in Nashville, TN. During that time she performed most notably as a member of the GRAMMY&reg;-nominated all-women bluegrass band Della Mae. She later joined Molly Tuttle & Golden Highway on bass and vocals, earning her first GRAMMY&reg; win for their 2023 album, City of Gold. Means is a driving player with a deep pocket, a singular stage presence, and a magnetic, centered approach to the upright bass. Beyond her work on the instrument, she's also an accomplished songwriter and a heartfelt vocalist whose voice is rooted in tradition while authentically her own. With her debut solo music Means invites listeners to experience the same soulful presence and adventurous spirit she has built her career on. Her singing and playing has been heard across the country and around the world, from NPR's airwaves, the Grand Ole Opry, Bonnaroo, Telluride Bluegrass Festival, and Newport Folk to the U.S. Virgin Islands, Kazakhstan, Australia, and beyond. MAYA DE VITRY Originally from Lancaster, PA, Maya de Vitry is a Nashville-based artist whose music blurs the lines of folk, indie rock, and Americana. An admirer of the dedicated song craft of writers like John Prine, Gillian Welch, and Townes Van Zandt — and of the stirring vocals of artists like Bonnie Raitt and Nina Simone — Maya de Vitry's music invites listeners into a space of openness and connection. After a formative chapter with the roots-Americana trio The Stray Birds, she launched her solo career with the 2019 album Adaptations, earning praise from Rolling Stone Country, NPR Music, and No Depression. Since then, she has built a devoted following, drawn to both her recordings and her powerful live performances. Known for her magnetic voice and hard-won sense of purpose, Maya has toured in North America and Europe, supporting artists like The Wood Brothers, Aoife O'Donovan, John Craigie, and Mighty Poplar. Her songs have also appeared on albums by Molly Tuttle, Lindsay Lou, and Steve Poltz, and her skills as a multi-instrumentalist and harmony singer have contributed to many Nashville recordings. Her fourth full-length release in just six years, The Only Moment, is a 10-track testament to personal reinvention and creative growth. \"I'm not just making different music now. It feels like I'm breathing in a different atmosphere,\" she reflects on her evolution from The Stray Birds to her solo journey. Her sense of liberation is especially apparent in her live shows, which have become a space for spontaneity, peace, and freedom, often woven together with personal stories that connect the songs. \"After the show, I just want to know if I've helped you feel more free,\" Maya says. \"That's my unspoken agreement—to myself, my bandmates, and everyone in the audience.\"",

    "description": "ALL AGES PARTIALLY SEATED SHOW (guaranteed seating AND standing room only tickets are available at checkout) DARRELL SCOTT Multi-Instrumentalist and Singer-Songwriter Darrell Scott mines and cultivates the everyday moment, taking the rote, menial, mundane, and allowing it to be surreal, ever poignant, and candidly honest, lilting, blooming, and resonating. The words he fosters allow us to make sense of the world, what is at stake here, and our place in it. And ultimately, Darrell knows the sole truth of life is that love is all that matters, that we don't always get it right, but that's the instinctive and requisite circuitous allure of things, why we forever chase it, and why it is held sacred. Darrell Scott comes from a musical family with a father who had him smitten with guitars by the age of 4, alongside a brother who played Jerry Reed style as well. From there, things only ramped up with literature and poetry endeavors while a student at Tufts University, along with playing his way through life. This would never change. After recently touring with Robert Plant and the Zac Brown Band (2 years with each), and producing albums for Malcolm Holcomb and Guy Clark and being named \"songwriter of the year\" for both ASCAP and NSAI, these days ﬁnd him roaming his Tennessee wilderness acreage hiking along the small river, creating delicious meals with food raised on his property and playing music. He often leads songwriting workshops to help people tell their own truths with their stories, and is as busy as always writing, producing, performing, and just plain fully immersing himself in life. WILL HOGE Will Hoge will release Sweet Misery, the Grammy-nominated artist's 15th studio album on Friday, August 22.On Sweet Misery, Hoge reminds listeners that he isn't afraid to break new ground - all while giving a keen nod to his rock and roll roots with the kind of grace and purpose that only comes with experience - without the baggage of predictability.In Will's own words - \"Following the re-recording and re-releases of Carousel and Blackbird On A Lonely Wire I found myself really wanting to make a louder, hooky, rock-n-roll band record again. Good stories, big choruses, shit to make you play it loud and drive fast with the windows down. I was without a band so I enlisted a crew of folks who I love - folks that I believed could really help bring out the bigger ideas in the songs. I hope folks will find some headphones and give it a good, loud listen. Top to bottom, the way albums should be listened to.\" Will Hoge has a career whose milestones include Number One hits, Grammy nods, major-label record deals, and hard-won independence. Years before Americana music received its own category at the Grammy Awards, Hoge was on the frontlines, helping to pilot and popularize the genre's blend of American roots music. In the current digital era dominated by influencers seeking shortcuts to stardom, Will Hoge proudly treads the scenic route, immersing himself in the journey rather than fixating on the destination.",

    "description": "ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY RATBOYS Despite its title, Ratboys' new album \"Singin' to an Empty Chair\" is not defined by what's missing. Rather, it's the beginning of an important dialogue with a close loved one vocalist Julia Steiner finds herself estranged from. The music on the band's sixth studio album – its first for New West Records – fills the space that person left behind with 11 songs showcasing Ratboys at the peak of their powers — twangy, effervescent, as confident as they've ever been, and perhaps more emotionally interrogative than ever before. The four-piece Chicago band followed up 2023's highly acclaimed \"The Window\" by reconvening with co-producer Chris Walla to begin tracking at a rural Wisconsin cabin before taking the songs to Steve Albini's famed Electrical Audio studios in Chicago and later to Rosebud Studio in Evanston, Illinois. The results veer from bubbly power-pop on \"Anywhere\" to irresistible post-country on \"Penny in the Lake,\" along with heart-piercing ballads like \"Just Want You to Know the Truth\" and an exhilarating detour into the extraterrestrial on \"Light Night Mountains All That,\" which Steiner dubs the band's mammoth \"wormhole jam.\" \"Singin' to an Empty Chair\" also marks the first Ratboys album written since Steiner began therapy, which the singer/lyricist credits for the clarity found across the album's unflinching examinations of relationship and self. Fittingly, as the album begins by extending a hand into the void, it concludes with a scene of serenity – all while weaving candid honesty, humor, chaos, and whimsy along the way. \"It's not all doom and gloom,\" Steiner says. \"The experience of making this record definitely gives me hope for whatever happens next.\" FLORRY For 'Sounds Like…' Florry's sophomore effort as a fully realized band, Francie Medosch and Co. decamped to Drop of Sun studios in the nest of the Blue Ridge Mountains to record with Asheville wunderkind Colin Miller, a critical voice behind the records of MJ Lenderman, Wednesday and Merce Lemon and a powerful songwriter in his own right. Three powerhouse days in late 2023 solidifi ed writing work done by the band earlier that summer in the now defunct Haw Creek compound under Miller's guiding suggestion. The result is a portrait of a ripping band cresting towards the height of their powers, uniquely equipped to capture a wildly loving, barn-burning camcorder clip of a turbulent trip with your best friends, without dipping into nostalgia bait. Lyrically, Medosch's utterances are both careful and excessive, the product of sifting through the rubble of classic good-time media, and fi nding what works for both her and her community to reach the heights of abandon.\"The Jackass theme song was actually a really big influence on the new album.\"",

    "description": "ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY TWEN Twen is a van-lifeing rock band that emerged onto the east coast music scene in 2017 with their distinct blend of shoegaze, indie rock, and post-punk influences. Though the band was formed in 2016 by lead vocalist Jane Fitzimmons and guitarist Ian Rollins Jones, their emergence post-pandemic has marked the beginning of what is essentially an entirely new project; save for their keeping the name \"Twen\". This latest chapter is marked by the band booking their own tours, designing and screen printing their own merch, directing and editing their own music videos, and producing and mixing their own albums; all to a degree which would seem impossible to believe, if you didn't know that they also built their own mobile-home from scratch and have been living in it, traversing the North American continent for the past 3 years. The duo-led 5 piece are readying their 3rd LP to be released in 2024, but have already debuted lead single 'SeaStar'; an early 00's throwback to Southern California beach anthems that finds the band further evolving from the coy, shoegaze aesthetics of 'Awestruck' (2019) – to a modern classicism; characterized on their 2nd LP 'One Stop Shop' (2022) by political (yet hopeful) lyrics, indelible hooks and a home-grown sonic mix that rewards the listener with each subsequent spin. With over 350 shows under their belt across North America and Europe, including arena appearances supporting Rainbow Kitten Surprise, Wet Leg, Whitney, Tacocat, & White Reaper, Twen's live show exhibits their all-around relevance as a DIY rock band thriving in the digital age.",

Don't get denied at the door, don't leave things up to chance: You will regret it.\" – Nashville Scene \"Rhymes worthy of Ogden Nash.\" – The New York Times \"Richman has spent decades removing barriers between himself and his audience, cultivating an intimacy that is almost extinct in modern music.\"- Nashville Scene \"As of a few years ago, I was going to just play theaters, cabarets and such, but we ended up by mistake at the Zebulon in Los Angeles and had such a fine time that those kind of shows have to happen too. So, you might see us nowadays in theaters, cabaret-style places, or the right club or bar. The theaters have the best sound, usually, and under-21s can get in, but in the clubs people can dance and get close in to ya, like we like. We'll keep trying things.\"",

    "description": "ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY JORDANA Jordana's music has always possessed a unique sense of place. You can hear the stillness of a Kansas bedroom on her 2020 debut Classical Notions… Humid late night New York walks on her double EP Something To Say To You. There's the kaleidoscopic otherworldliness of Summer's Over, her collab release with TV Girl. The unmistakable sunshine of LA on 2024's Lively Premonitions. But on her new semi self-titled project, Jordanaland, the 25-year-old songwriter has officially crafted a place all her own. \"Jordanaland is definitely an escape from Americaland. It looks a lot like LA in the videos…for some reason. Weird,\" muses Jordana. \"But it's wherever you want it to be, just close your eyes.\" Recorded with her friends Charlie Kilgore & Julian Kaufman of offkilter pop group MICHELLE, the EP drops Jordana in her most brightly-colored surroundings yet. Mixed by a pair of Grammy Award winners in Olli Jacobs (Kendrick Lamar, Taylor Swift, beabadoobee) & David Pizzimenti (Ella Mai, Ed Sheeren, Travis Scott), these songs soar with a sonic confidence that has previously only made occasional appearances in her discography. \"Pop music was definitely the goal,\" says Jordana. \"Self assured, confident pop. I think the evolution came from becoming more comfortable with my voice, a more established sound, and also looking up to artists who let it all out in that way. I was pretty intimidated at first, because I love MICHELLE. They're powerhouses. So I tried leaning into their energy, and I'm in love with what we made.\" Of course, if her catalog is any indication, this might simply be a pitstop in a world of pop, but it's a fully realized one. And in Jordanaland, she's running for president. And she's ruling with a very adorable iron fist. At the same time, the EP is littered with picture-perfect love songs & down bad kissoffs. The revved-up jangle pop of \"Burning Me Down\" and yearning ballad \"I Wanna Be\" are universal tracks about relationships, while the lithe \"Blouse\" is about one-sided romantic intimacy and wondering if there's potential for more. Jordana has come a long way from that still Kansas bedroom in 2020, reinventing herself and her surroundings multiple times over. \"It does feel liberating,\" says Jordana, of her reputation as a genre chameleon. \"There's no expectation for me, or at least no expectation I'm paying attention to. I get to try new things all the time. It's kind of like going to a theme park and seeing a bunch of your favorite rides and running over to each of them in excitement — each ride offers so many different feelings and experiences, that it's so hard to choose only one to ride for the rest of the day.\" If you want to find her today, she's riding a dazzling rollercoaster named Jordanaland. Tomorrow? We'll have to wait and see where the journey leads. the booyah! kids The booyah! kids are a three piece indie outfit from NYC. Julian, Aidan, and Emma sing together, telling stories from their bedrooms. A good booyah song should feel like a friend of yours.",

With her 2026 release Appalachia — recorded at Dreamland Recording Studios with Grammy-nominated producer Josh Kaufman — Robinson opens herself up to experimentation and sings in her crystal-clear voice about resilience, love, grief and hope. Robinson's talent is no surprise to the music industry — she's now a veteran touring artist, both at home and abroad. Her records Traveling Mercies (2019) and American Siren (2021) each landed high on Rolling Stone's \"Best Country and Americana Albums\" and Stereogum's \"10 Best Country Albums\" year-end lists. She's been lauded by the Washington Post, Billboard, American Songwriter and No Depression, and earned the 19th spot on NPR's \"100 Best Songs of 2021\" with her song \"Let 'Em Burn.\" It was her 2020 release \"The Time for Flowers,\" an anthem of hope recorded at home in the midst of the global pandemic, that caught the attention of Oh Boy Records, the independent label founded by John Prine in 1981. Robinson jumped at the opportunity to join the free-spirited and beloved record label carrying on her hero's legacy. Robinson believes the songs on Appalachia are the best she's ever written — she sings about her grandmother slipping into dementia, a cash-only saloon full of characters, and gratitude for life, despite its hardships. The album features a duet with Grammy winner John Paul White that celebrates the kind of love that comes with scars and age, and a hymn for anyone who's ever failed or fallen short. \"There's this thing I do with every record I make,\" she says. \"I knit a prayer into it, and I ask for all these songs to find their way to everyone who needs them. I ask these songs to be of service, to help people find and experience joy.\"",

Della Mae is one such band. The GRAMMY-nominated string band was founded in 2010 and over the next decade and a half they've demonstrated to the roots music world, once and for all, that a band of all women is not, nor has ever been, a mere novelty. They remain at the forefront of the explosion of women instrumentalists and all-women acts in roots music and their impact is striking and measurable – not just in North America, but around the globe. Now 15 years since their origin, Della Mae can boast their strongest lineup yet. Founders Kimber Ludiker and Celia Woodsmith are joined by guitarist and songwriter Avril Smith and vocalist and two-time IBMA Bass Player of the Year Vickie Vaughn. There has never been a band like Della Mae in roots music before, but thanks to Kimber Ludiker, Celia Woodsmith, Avril Smith, Vickie Vaughn – and all of the women who have been part of this band over its long life – we know there will be many more bands, singers, songwriters, and pickers just like Della Mae in the future.",

    "description": "ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY FUST Fust — the Durham, North Carolina-based band — announce their new album, Big Ugly, out March 7th via Dear Life Records. Big Ugly arrives after the release of 2024's Songs of the Rail––\"one of the best alt-country compilations…in a long, long time\" (Paste) –– and 2023's standout Genevieve, which unassumingly introduced new listeners to Fust's unmistakable blend of \"small-town poetry\" (Mojo) with a familiar yet probing \"country-tinged folk-rock\" (KEXP) that made it \"one of the most fun rock records of the year\" (Pitchfork).Big Ugly finds Fust taking its \"gutsy, blue-collar Americana\" (New Commute) further than it has before. Songwriter Aaron Dowdy pushes his obsessions with country-storytelling to more mystifying places, telling stories of Southern life teeming with utopian possibility that arises uniquely from the contradictions for which the south is infamously known. In this way, it is a record that could easily be filed on the record shelf alongside lyric-forward indie or Southern rock, as well as on the bookshelf amongst the throngs of Southern literature hellbent on proving the elegance of grittiness. Big Ugly is also Fust––above all a group of close friends––uncovering a freedom within their sincere form of loose and fried guitar rock, emboldened to deliver both their most intimate songwriting and biggest sound to date.While perhaps \"few voices can write a song quite like Aaron Dowdy\" (Paste), it is clear upon listening that Big Ugly is an album of fully recognizable voices. One hears in the music the years of interplay between Avery Sullivan (Sluice) on Drums, Justin Morris (Sluice, Weirs) on guitar and vocals, Oliver Child-Lanning (Sluice, Weirs) on bass and vocals, Frank Meadows on piano, John Wallace (Colamo) on guitar and vocals, and Libby Rodenbough (Mipso) on fiddle and vocals. Big Ugly is also the second collaboration with the Asheville-based engineer Alex Farrar, recorded together throughout the summer of 2024 at Drop of Sun Studio. And with the help of many friends including Merce Lemon, Dave Hartley (The War on Drugs), and John James Tourville (The Deslondes), Big Ugly is exactly what one feels it to be: a huge group of people gathered together, stumbling upon songs amidst long days and even longer nights. MERCE LEMON \"I could not be alive alone,\" a longtime family friend says with a smile. \"None of us could be alive alone.\" Within the quiet, cascading corners of Pittsburgh lies a community – nothing short of one large family – that spans zip codes, histories, occupations, and generations, always tumbling inwardly into itself, propped up by steadfast pillars of conviction toward spiritual and emotional mutual aid. The kind of earnest community scaffolding that gets bandied about, wielded as conjecture, particularly in an age of increasing fracture through digital sublimation, is alive and quite well within the universe surrounding Merce Lemon.

    "description": "ALL AGES FULLY SEATED SHOW LIMITED NUMBER OF PREMIUM SEATING TICKETS AVAILABLE CHRIS SMITHER The sound and imagery of the 20th release by Chris Smither, All About the Bones, (release date: May 3, 2024 on Signature Sounds/Mighty Albert, distributed by Redeye) is as elemental as the inky black shadows cast by a shockingly bright moon. The listener is welcomed into some gothic mansion on an imaginary New Orleans street, and there in the lamplit parlor confronts the band, a minimalist skeleton crew: Smither's inimitable propulsive guitar and rumbling baritone are joined seamlessly to producer David Goodrich's carpetbag of instruments, Zak Trojano's rock-steady, primal drumming, BettySoo's diaphanous harmony vocals, and the flat, mournful flood of Jazz legend Chris Cheek's saxophone. Recorded at Sonelab Studios in Easthampton MA by Justin Pizzoferrato (Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr., the Hold Steady) All About the Bones has a feel that is somehow baroque and austere at once. Smither and his longtime producer David Goodrich have been refining their musical conversation for decades, both in the studio and onstage, and by now, their bond verges on the telepathic. Goodrich plays on nearly every track. His sound is by now so translucent that it seems to function as a swath of silence, allowing the songs to burn like ciphers in the crackling air. And oh, the songs on All About the Bones. Chris Smither, after six decades of sharpening his knife as a songwriter, can at this point open damn near anything with a flick of his wrist. God and the Devil are opened here. Mortality is too. Politics, consciousness, renewal, family, vulnerability, surrender… Smither has sat with these topics like so many Zen koans, for so long, that every line is a pearl. The title track, \"All About the Bones,\" kicks the record off with \"Consider your high station/ think about your fame. All of your creation depended on your frame.\" Irony, wit, the double meaning of \"depended\"… each verse is a master class in songwriting. Yet the stark, elemental sage always has a twinkle in his eye, a light touch at your elbow as he guides you along. From the wickedly funny defense of the Adversary in \"If Not for the Devil\" to the unsentimental open-heartedness of \"Still Believe in You,\" he is as human as we all long to be. The disjointed imagery of \"In the Bardo\" and the dystopian mirror of \"Close the Deal\" find Smither unflinchingly staring down the mortality of both individuals and republics, and yet he is at peace, among loved ones in his cover of Eliza Gilkyson's \"Calm Before the Storm,\" and turning his gaze to the future in \"Completion\". As noted by the New York Times, Rolling Stone, MOJO, NPR, and others, in the decades of travels to All About the Bones, Chris Smither has gone from up-and-comer to journeyman to veteran to icon, and yet the whole time his path has more closely resembled Joseph Campbell's \"Hero with a Thousand Faces\"- an unblinking, fearless trek into the depths of struggle and revelation, and a return back to the land of the living, to share the hard-won treasures found along the way. His restlessness is long gone, and his eyes are fixed \"where the moonlight falls on some never-to-be-seen horizon\" (\"Still Believe in You\"). The light given off from his music casts our own lives into a sublime and welcome clarity.",

In that time, the New York-based band has released a pair of well-received albums, an EP, and played countless shows. Prior to the pandemic, the band was really starting to hit its stride. They had a system in place and were spreading their brand of melodic rock to the masses. In fact, they could count Jack White, Arctic Monkeys, and Orville Peck as vocal supporters, which led to support slots for each. Soon, incredible live appearances at Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, Newport Folk Festival, and Shaky Knees became the norm. Over the course of the last two years, The Nude Party decided to produce their new album, Rides On, themselves. With the help of Matthew Horner, The Nude Party had as much fun creating as they ever had at any other point in their career. Their new album includes 14 songs that dabble in electro-pop and stripped-down country. The Nude Party coalesced and embraced the spirit of collaboration. They're excited to begin the next chapter of their career. At a time when it would have been easy to pack it in, the band continues to persevere. TOBACCO CITY Tobacco City is a Chicago-based band that blends cosmic country with a mix of psychedelic rock and honky-tonk soul. Their sound captures the essence of small-town nostalgia while embracing modern-day themes, exploring heartache, longing, and the bittersweet nature of life. With their uplifting energy and authentic songwriting, Tobacco City continues to carve out a unique space in the country-tinged Americana scene.",

Hailing from Irvine, California (USA), DANCE WITH THE DEAD continue to push the boundaries of retro-futuristic soundscapes and cinematic storytelling. The project first emerged on Halloween night in 2013 with their debut release, setting the tone for a career defined by innovation and an ever-evolving sonic identity. Their early work—spanning atmospheric orchestral-leaning pieces and aggressive synth metal—solidified their presence with fan-favorite releases such as Into the Abyss (EP), Near Dark, and crossover hits like \"Andromeda\" and \"Invader.\" Their influence within the synthwave world earned them a featured appearance in the acclaimed documentary The Rise of the Synths, narrated by filmmaker John Carpenter. DANCE WITH THE DEAD's distinctive sound merges analog synth textures with the raw grit of early heavy metal guitars—a combination shaped by influences such as Hans Zimmer, Justice, Daft Punk, The Misfits, White Zombie, Ozzy Osbourne, Alice Cooper, Kavinsky, Metallica, and John Carpenter. Their catalog has featured notable collaborations as well, including guest contributions from John Carpenter and Cody Carpenter (Driven to Madness), as well as Nick Hipa and professional skateboarder Elliot Sloan (Loved to Death). MAGIC SWORD Magic Sword is an ageless tale of good and evil told through an ever expanding graphic novel with each volume accompanied by an original, synth-heavy soundtrack as well as immersive live performances. With the three mediums intertwined from conception, together they create an epic experience for those bold enough to bear witness and come away with a deeper understanding of the ultimate hero's journey. Armed with a musical and visual aesthetic that has its roots unabashedly buried deep in the golden era of '70s and '80s fantasy and sci-fi, Magic Sword's followers are called to another plane of existence where the struggle between light and shadow becomes all too real. The multiverse has aligned to bring the people of the land together for the birth of their album Endless, followed by a tour of the realm searching for the greater good.
