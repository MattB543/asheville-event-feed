Blind Date Live
Doors: February 21, 2026 6:30 PM
Online Scheduled Ticket Price: ADVANCED: $22.00 DAY OF: $25.00

Asheville, are you ready to heat things up? Blind Date Live is back at The Orange Peel on February 21st, 2026! Voted Best Comedy Event in the 2025 Best of WNC Awards, this live show promises a night where love is unscripted, unfiltered, and more than a little unpredictable.Whether you're single and ready to mingle or just there to see sparks fly, this is your chance to witness true love unfold in real time. Doors open at 6:30 PM, and we’re kicking things off with a sultry mixer from 6:30-7:30 PM to set the mood. Slip into the crowd, grab a drink, and who knows, you might just lock eyes with someone special. Or... maybe they’re just looking for the bathroom. How about that one? Oh, nope, they're waving to their friend behind you. Awkward. Then, at 8 PM, the real fun begins. Hosted by Donnie Rex Bishop and Cayla Clark, watch as real Asheville singles dive headfirst into live first dates onstage. Meanwhile, the fabulous Toni Brown will be our maître d', making sure everything runs smoothly, and DJ Lil Meow Meow will be spinning tunes to keep the energy going all night long.

There might be fireworks, there WILL be intense oversharing, and you’ll be on the edge of your seat through it all. Don’t worry, though—the audience is strictly there to watch. No participation required. This isn’t just another night out. It’s steamy, unpredictable, and full of moments you’ll never forget (and a few you might wish you could). Whether you’re here to watch romance bloom, relish in the awkward moments, or just soak up the perversion, Blind Date Live has you covered. See you there.

What is it that you’ve been carrying around all this time? The unsaid. The unheard. What desires unexpressed are tip toeing around your heart? Or burning hot and tumultuous behind your rib cage, as embers do? What apology hibernates at the base of your spine, like a winter snake, slowly circling but never rising? What whispers of I love you are just beyond the wall of time, never for your ears, not yet, and you yearn for them? Endlessly. Make your reservation. Bring your regrets. To the mysterious territory of the dying. Come, to the table of the ever after. Asheville Fringe Arts Festival 2026 March 21, 2026 at 2pm March 22, 2026 at 1pm

We’re doing something that feels overdue.

**On March 10th, every women’s business group in WNC is gathering under one roof for the first time.**

Not for a panel. Not for pitches. **Just to show up, connect, and remind each other that we’re not building alone.**

Here’s what’s happening:

🍹 Drinks & vibes [@themuleavl](https://www.instagram.com/themuleavl/)

🌸 Photo moments with [@ashevilleflowerwalls](https://www.instagram.com/ashevilleflowerwalls/) and the talented [@emilyfortunephotography](https://www.instagram.com/emilyfortunephotography/)

🚚 Food truck on site (because good conversation needs good food)

🎤 Community announcements & intros

🤝 The chance to meet women business owners across ALL our incredible regional groups

This isn’t about networking in the traditional sense. It’s about creating visibility for the support that already exists here, and making sure every woman building something in this region knows just how many people have her back.

Who’s coming together:

<summary>Full Description</summary>

Now some new things have come to light, and they are rolling around in the ol’ Duder’s head, so pay attention.

In the year of our Dude, 1998 the story of a man from Los Angeles, the city of Angels, unfolded. Sometimes there’s a man, and he’s the man for his time and place. In that time and place, as it could be today, that man was the Dude.

In celebration of that historic event 28 years ago we give you the Day of the Dude Hash. This day where we celebrate all things Dude: Nihilism, 8 year olds (dude), sarsaparilla, following the rules AND crossing the line, zesty enterprises, $1000 for doing (something that can't be mentioned here) and watching, severed toes, and just being out of our element.

Come dressed as your favorite character or prop from the movie. There will be a White [Ukrainian] stop(s), bowling balls, and possibly a little Credence. It’s NOT pet-friendly, so leave your favorite marmot or whatever at home, dude. Be sure to bring along the normal hash stuff, chairs, dry clothes, and your favorite rug to help tie the room together.

**WHERE:** AMF Star Lanes - 491 Kenilworth Rd, Asheville, NC 28805

**WHEN:** Date, Standard start is 2pm gather, 2:30pm Hares away
**HARES:** Body Glide
**HASH CASH:** **_$8._** (**$5** non-alcohol options) for beer only.
**SHIGGY LEVEL:** Probably on the low end... maybe a 1 or 2.

**ON-ON! (your salutation) PLEASE ADVERTISE YOUR TRAIL!**
\*\*All events are intended for those 21 years old and up unless otherwise specified\*\*

| Asheville Weird      | 8/10      |
| Social / Meet People | 9/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** A one‑year anniversary potluck + collective tarot is a special one‑off community ritual (not super rare but not recurring weekly). It’s highly distinctive and very Asheville‑y, hosted in a small local spiritual venue so modest draw, but excellent for meeting people and immersive communal vibe.

**AI Summary:** Community potluck and collective tarot reading blending shared food and reflective ritual to mark the one year venue milestone. Free open door gathering inviting dish contributions and gentle social connection in a welcoming atmosphere.

| Asheville Weird      | 8/10      |
| Social / Meet People | 9/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** A one-night, facilitated consent-based platonic touch circle is fairly limited (often sells out) and very high-concept/Asheville-quirky, but it’s a small, hyper-local wellness gathering—excellent for making deep social connections though not a large draw.

**AI Summary:** Facilitated consent centered platonic touch sessions focused on nervous system regulation and trust building with guided consent practices in a welcoming circle; optional nonsexual touch and somatic exercises create a grounded, respectful space.

<details>
<summary>Full Description</summary>

## **Safe Space • Real Connection**

**Platonic Snuggles** is a facilitated, consent-centered gathering offering nurturing, platonic touch and authentic connection in a grounded, respectful space.

There is no dating or romantic intention — this experience is designed to support nervous system regulation, trust-building, and honoring personal boundaries. All touch is optional, and all activities are invitations, never obligations.

We begin with a welcoming circle and guided consent practices, followed by gentle connection in a cozy home setting. No prior experience is needed.

Held in a private West Asheville home. Address shared after registration.

### **💜 Energy Exchange**

**$30–$45 sliding scale**

Please secure your spot using the Zeffy [ticket link here](https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/platonic-snuggles-2).
Your RSVP on Meetup is not confirmed until payment is received.

This gathering is intentionally curated with thoughtful lighting, ambient sound, and a regulated container to support relaxation and nervous system care.

One scholarship and one work-trade spot are available for each gathering. Please reach out privately if support is needed.

Space is limited to maintain an intimate, safe container.

**AI Summary:** High-energy contra dance with caller George Segebade and the Tune Drivers’ old-time string band—fiddles, banjo, mandolin, guitar, and bass—free beginner lesson 7:30, social dance 8–11 at Bryson Gym.

**Score Reasoning:** Inaugural, one-night multi‑community women-in-business mixer (so somewhat missable and special), good local draw at a taproom but not a regional headliner, solidly social and useful for meeting people, not particularly “weird” or high‑production.

**AI Summary:** Casual evening mixer uniting 10+ women-in-business communities across WNC for intentional networking, cross-sector connections, resource exchange, and peer support in a relaxed beverage taproom setting.

| Asheville Weird      | 8/10      |
| Social / Meet People | 9/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** Low-missable local wellness meetup (similar sessions recur) so rarity is low; a niche, consent-forward platonic cuddle has high ‘main character’/unique energy (Asheville-weird bonus applied); small community-scale draw; very much fits Asheville’s quirky/progressive scene; and explicitly designed for connection, so strong social potential.

**AI Summary:** Warm, consent focused platonic touch afternoon for people who identify as female, non-binary, or trans masc; facilitated group and partner cuddles create an inclusive, nonsexual space, registration required online.

<details>
<summary>Full Description</summary>

[To register for this event click here.](https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/thursday-march-19th-abcd-anyone-but-cis-dude-platonic-cuddle)
Join us for an afternoon of warmth, connection, and platonic touch. This cuddle event is dedicated to celebrating the beauty of human connection and fostering a safe and inclusive space for individuals of all backgrounds who self identify as female, non-binary, or trans masc. Come as you are, and let's create a space where warmth, understanding, and connection thrive. Excluding cis men from this event is an way to create a space where some participants feel more at ease, allowing them to engage in cuddling without triggering past discomfort.

This is a non-sexual touch based event that invites participants to explore platonic intimacy with like-minded people in an environment that upholds personal boundaries and respect through a supportive framework of mutual agreements that maximize safety and create a space of easy openness and compassionate connection.
At this event we have the chance to normalize touch and intimacy with clear boundaries; this is a space for respectful, consent-based touch. We allow ourselves to be seen. We have fun. We get our touch needs met.

**THE RULES:**
1\. Clothes stay on for the whole event\.
2\. You do not have to touch anyone at this event\.
3\. You must ask permission and receive a verbal YES before you touch anyone\. Please be specific in your requests\.
4\. If you feel a yes\, say YES\. If you feel a no\, say NO\. If you’re a maybe\, say NO\. You can always change your mind\.
5\. Get your facilitator if you have a question or concern\, or if you need assistance with anything during the event\.
6\. Talking\, laughter\, silence\, silliness\, stillness\, and crying are welcome\.

**WHY CUDDLE?**
Touch is a basic human need, and many of us do not get enough; most people don’t even know they are missing touch, or have a way to ask for touch without sexualizing it. We believe deeply in the power of touch, and the importance of communication and consent in creating a safe space for touch.
CUDDLING WITH STRANGERS
Cuddling with strangers sounds weird or scary to most people. “Will I like it?” “What if someone wants to touch me and I don’t want to?” “What if I say yes and it’s not what I want?” “What if I really want to touch someone and they say no?” These are all normal questions. The answer is that this is a space created to ask for exactly what you want, and receive NOTHING you don’t want. Many people start out nervous at a cuddle event. Most are really, really glad they came.

**Schedule:**
Arrive with snacks to share! Get comfortable, meet, mingle, & snack.
Welcome Circle- its mandatory. We will set our container, talk about personal boundaries, communication, & consent.
Icebreakers and connective activities.
Open cuddling! You MUST ask and get a verbal ‘yes’ before touching or cuddling with anybody at this event. If you are not sure how to do this – great! – we will talk about...

**Score Reasoning:** A rare Saturn–Neptune meetup at 0° Aries makes this a timely one-off (high rarity). The myth-driven, embodied ritual format is high-concept and distinctly Asheville (unique + local weird bonus). It’s a small, paid workshop at The Well (modest magnitude) and is set up as an intimate, participatory circle—great for meeting people.

**AI Summary:** Three-hour astrology workshop exploring the Saturn–Neptune meeting at 0° Aries through myth-driven guided reflection, embodiment, and creative expression. Participants shape the cosmic “birth” into personal intentions, discernment, and concrete action in an intimate, embodied ritual.

<details>
<summary>Full Description</summary>

**0° Aries is the moment of birth—where creation begins again. That’s where Saturn and Neptune meet in 2026.** This rare reset asks for participation: intention, discernment, and action—not drifting.

In myth, when repression breaks, love is born—along with fierce consequence and raw power. How we meet a beginning matters. In this **3-hour, in-person experiential workshop**, you’ll enter the myth through guided reflection, embodiment, and creative expression, and make it personal: **what are you willing to bring into being now?**

**You’ll leave with a simple, repeatable ritual to anchor intention into action as this Saturn–Neptune cycle unfolds—so “love” becomes something you live, not something you hope for.**

**Score Reasoning:** Single-night visit from a small-batch Sta. Rita Hills winemaker with limited releases makes this a missable, high-quality niche experience (rarity 8). A curated winemaker dinner feels high-concept for wine fans (unique 7) but is a professional local-scale event at The Argot Room (magnitude 5). It’s not particularly ‘weird Asheville’—more upscale/foodie than offbeat (ashevilleWeird 3)—and the intimate, multi-course format with the winemaker present makes it strong for conversation and meeting oth

**AI Summary:** Matt Brady of SAMSARA Wine Co. hosts an intimate winemaker dinner spotlighting limited release cool climate Pinot Noir, Syrah, Grenache, and Chardonnay from Sta. Rita Hills paired with a curated multi course menu.

<details>
<summary>Full Description</summary>

**SAMsARA Wine Co. is a small boutique winery producing roughly 2,500 cases annually, specializing in sustainably farmed, cool-climate Pinot Noir, Syrah, Grenache, and Chardonnay from the Sta. Rita Hills in Santa Barbara, CA.**

**AI Summary:** Deep-dive acting workshop teaching heel turns and antagonists to anchor scenes and heighten stakes through character work, scene-level choices, and interactive improvisation exercises for improvisors and actors seeking stronger conflicts and clearer hero-villain dynamics.

<details>
<summary>Full Description</summary>

Learn how to anchor any story and heighten the stakes with a good heel turn. For improvisors and actors wanting to go deeper.

Most stories are only as good as their villains. Whether you are improvising long form stories or you've just been cast as the antagonist in someone else's story ... the villain is an immense opportunity to heighten the story, crystalize our hero, and draw the audience deeper into the world of the story. Besides, they're usually more fun to play anyway. We will explore villains across different genres, and give ourselves permission to take up a lot space.

This is an 8-week class series beginning on January 10 and meeting weekly until February 28.

**Score Reasoning:** Ten-week seasonal community chorus is a limited-run opportunity (rarity 6). Teaching multipart world songs by ear and a relaxed potluck concert gives strong high-concept, locally distinctive appeal (unique 9).

Excellent social potential for meeting people and joining a community (social 8).

_What folks are saying about singing in WACC?_

"Suzannah is the best teacher of anything I have ever had!" - Scotty

“The talent and the passion you bring to singing is awe inspiring and touched my heart in ways I have never experienced. I haven’t cried in a long time but being with you and experiencing your gentle spirit, your unbridled love for singing, and your unique ability to create community out of diversity moved me deeply into “joyful” tears! I’m jealous of those fortunate souls who get to work with you regularly. You didn’t just touch my heart last week, you enriched my soul, and you brought me home again, to that place that only music can take you. I am forever in your debt. ”
— Bill

“I love being around you on a weekly basis. You are such a joy and I love the way you communicate and teach music.....It’s like you have us all under a magical spell that makes our hearts swell up and produce beautiful harmonies. It’s so different than any other choir I’ve ever been a part of.” - Jackie
