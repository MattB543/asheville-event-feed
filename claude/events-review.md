**Score Reason:** An annual-style New Year’s party (common in the market) keeps rarity low, the Chicago funk-soul band adds some novelty but there are many similar NYE shows locally so uniqueness is modest, and the Asheville Music Hall booking with a touring act suggests a solid regional-level production.

**Score Reason:** An annual-style New Year astrology forecast at a library is fairly common in the season (many similar visioning/astrology events), it's a participant-led community meetup rather than a unique or high-production spectacle, and is free/low-budget so the production magnitude is very modest.
