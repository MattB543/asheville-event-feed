You will be provided with your sanitized supplies, or feel free to bring your own colored pencils, markers, or other art supplies to express yourself during this Connection Practice Meeting.

A Connection Practice is a meeting to practice your skills in listening and connecting with others. No conversation topic is off limits. The only objective of the meeting is to feel a genuine sense of connection by the time it's over, and the only rule is that we promise to not give each other advice.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates. All connection practices are free of charge.

Sanders, Boyd, Page & Hall distill the pure essence of improvisational expression, converging as alchemists of sound, transmuting musical elements into their most essential forms. This quartet embodies the philosophical concept of quintessence-the fifth element beyond earth, air, fire, and water-representing the fundamental substance from which all musical reality springs. Their original compositions crystallize the essential qualities of diverse influences, oscillating between through-composed musical themes, groove-based soul explorations, traditional jazz-influenced pieces, Americana-inspired peaceful melodicism, world music influences, free jazz adventures, and occasional forays into cacophonous noise music. Through years of improvisational study, they've learned to access that rarefied space where genres dissolve into pure creative energy. In this musical laboratory, Sanders' guitar becomes a conduit for universal vibration, Boyd's reeds channel the breath of consciousness itself, Page's bass provides the fundamental frequency of existence, while Hall's percussion creates the rhythmic heartbeat of the cosmos.

**AI Summary:** Featuring structured 60-minute timed writing sprints with quick intros for focused, accountability-driven co-writing.

### Description

Shut Up & Write!

**Here's how it works.** Show up at or before 6:00. At 6:00, we do some quick introductions. Afterward, for a full 60 minutes (I'll set a timer!) we are heads-down writing. Writing what? A novel? You bet. Some poetry? Sure. Song lyrics? Your resume? That report you need to get to your boss before 8 AM or you'll *need* *to write* that resume? All of the above and more. Just shut up and write.

Surrounding ourselves with other writers who are busy putting words onto page (physical or virtual) keeps us all accountable and focused.

When the timer goes off, we'll check-in with each other and see how it went. Afterward, feel free to stay to chat and get to know your fellow writers, or keep writing, or take off.

Socializing is optional and will happen after (or briefly before) the focused writing. This is a safe space to work on your craft. No one will read or critique your writing.

For more information about our events, visit [https://shutupwrite.com](https://shutupwrite.com).

**What to Expect**

* Roughly 15 minutes of introductions
* 60 minutes of focused writing (somebody set a timer)!
* Afterward, optional socializing

**Being late is okay:** Just show up and get settled, then check in with the host after the session. (Look for the person with the Shut Up & Write sign).

**What Should I Bring?**

* Whatever you need to be able to write!
* Earbuds/earplugs if you want to block ambient noise.

**Other Important Details:**

HOSTS: This is a multi-host event, so most of the time there will be a host present. If we are unlucky and no host can attend, please find each other and self-organize. Pay attention to the event chat and comments to see who is available.

WI-FI: Yes!

PARKING: Street parking in metered spots is free after 6pm. Closest municipal garages ($2/hour) are Wall St. & Coxe Street/Sears Alley.

### Description

Launched in August of 2020, Tuesday Casual Collaborations at 185 King Street has become a cornerstone of the vibrant Brevard music community. Every week Travis Book assembles a unique group of musicians for a one-time-only show, drawing on his vast network of friends and growing repertoire of musical styles. From Bluegrass to Blues, Songwriter to Americana, Country to Funk, Travis and his ever-evolving cast of local and national (even international) musicians consistently hit the sweet spot between preparation and spontaneity. “Eventually, I hope to play with everyone!” he occasionally boasts, and he’s well on his way. Travis has hosted a wide range of musicians, including: Anders Beck, Nicki Bluhm, Josh Daniel, Beppe Gambetta, Mike Guggino, Vince Herman, Sierra Hull, Cris Jacobs, Jim Lauderdale, Lindsay Lou, Steve McMurry, Mimi Naja, Tim O’Brien, Woody Platt, Jon Stickley, Kyle Tuttle, and Cristina Vane. He also regularly employs the skills of world-class local musicians like Jeff Sipe, Mike Ashworth, Tommy Maher, Bennett Sullivan, and Derick Gardner. Every week is unique, the musical styles wide-ranging, but the one thing that remains constant is the intention, positivity, and charisma that Travis brings to each and every show. This week’s show will be hosted by Brevard Native, Clint Roberts. He will be bringing along his band “Holler Choir.”

This holiday season, Asheville locals and visitors are invited to sip, stroll, and support a great cause with the launch of the 12 Bars of Christmas, a citywide holiday collaboration benefiting MANNA FoodBank. The event brings together beloved local bars, festive spirits, & generous hearts to help fight hunger across WNC while also offering a meaningful way to support businesses still recovering from Helene.

HOW IT WORKS

Participants can join the fun by visiting any participating venue and making a $15 donation to receive their official 12 Bars of Christmas Passport. 100% of all passport proceeds go directly to MANNA FoodBank, whose mission is to involve, educate, and unite people in the fight to end hunger in WNC.

With a passport in hand, the holiday adventure begins. Guests collect a stamp while visiting each of the 12 participating bars, and those who complete all 12 stamps will receive a 2025 limited-edition keepsake ornament to celebrate their community spirit (while supplies last). It’s a chance to explore Asheville’s vibrant bar scene, enjoy festive specials, and show love to local businesses working hard to bounce back this season.

Participants can also submit their passport’s entry form at any bar for a chance to win big in the 12 Bars of Christmas Charity Raffle, with a live drawing on January 6.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates.

**Score:** 18/30 (Rarity: 7, Unique: 6, Magnitude: 5)
**Score Reason:** An intimate, once-a-year NYE jazz party in the retro Palm Room — stylish and likely in-demand but a boutique/local hotel-bar production rather than a regional touring headliner.

**AI Summary:** Featuring vintage lounge jazz, a retro 1970s ambiance, and dual countdowns with a signature Fitz75 cocktail.

### Description

Step into The Palm Room for New Year’s Eve and you’ll find a warm, retro holiday glow that feels straight out of a 1970s lounge. Soft lights, rich colors, a little sparkle in the air, and live jazz that makes the whole room feel like it’s humming. To welcome 2026, we’re hosting two countdowns, each with its own flavor and a Fitz75 to kick things off.

Twilight Countdown: 5:30pm seating. Music from 6pm to 9pm. Ease into the night with Meschiya Lake & her Speakeasy 3 bringing vintage charm and smooth swing. Guests are welcomed with a Fitz 75, followed by heavy apps that keep the evening social and satisfying.

**Score:** 20/30 (Rarity: 7, Unique: 7, Magnitude: 6)
**Score Reason:** NYE-only watch party with a champagne toast makes it time-sensitive and missable; 270° projection mapping gives strong experiential ‘main‑character’ energy; but it’s a local/small-venue screening (not the touring act), so draw is regional/enthusiast-level.

### Description

Modelface Comedy brings you the best comedians from all over the country. This week we have Caleb Synan from Los Angeles for a NYE show!

Caleb Synan is one of the hottest young comics in the country. (Funny AND good looking!) His unique background as a preacher’s kid from a small southern town gives him the ability to relate to any and every crowd -- even though he’s a big old millennial who lives in LA. Want proof? He’s performed on CONAN (twice!), Last Comic Standing (once!), and his first Comedy Central special “30” in 2022 (You can watch it on YouTube!)

He’s also entertained our troops in South Korea and Japan. What a guy! It’s no wonder he won the title of "Wittiest" in Franklin County High School’s 2009 Yearbook. He even wrote this bio himself. And he’ll have a margarita with you if you play your cards right.

ages 18+ Doors at 6:30pm, show at 7pm

Tickets $20 advance, $25 day of $28 premium seating (guaranteed table seating in the front three rows)

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP

**Tags:** Wellness, Spiritual

**Score:** 14/30 (Rarity: 6, Unique: 5, Magnitude: 3)
**Score Reason:** Free New Year’s‑Eve tarot + tea session feels like a one‑off seasonal offering (missable) but sits squarely in the common Asheville wellness circuit — a cozy, locally run spiritual experience at a small venue rather than a high‑profile draw.

**AI Summary:** Offering collective tarot guidance followed by brief individual readings with an energetic focus and calming herbal tea.

**Score:** 17/30 (Rarity: 7, Unique: 5, Magnitude: 5)
**Score Reason:** Annual New Year’s Eve single-night event at a downtown brewery — somewhat missable if you don’t go out for NYE (special night). Fun, crowd-pleasing DJ countdown, dance contests and champagne give it pop but it’s a familiar nightlife format rather than a novel production. Local venue with a solid but not regional/national draw.

**AI Summary:** Featuring two DJ sets counting down top 25 songs of 2025, after-midnight millennium dance hits, and a champagne toast.

About this Event
"Caring for myself is not self - indulgence; it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare." Audre Lorde

This is an invitation specifically for persons who identify as Black or African American and are overwhelmed with the injustice of the world and are ready to create space in their lives for self-care as we fight for justice for all! (We offer a parallel session for Allies to connect, learn and find support in their work to dismantle racism at allies.eventbrite.com)

We believe Black people deserve a space to relax, reassess, and realign ourselves.

We are a collective of Black stress-management & wellness instructors inspired by human values.

We are here to facilitate your journey of trauma-relief and stress-management.

Imagine how much more energy you will have and how much more powerful you will be when you cut your stress levels in half!

And it can be done in just a few minutes using nothing but your own breath...

Over the last 10 years, we've taught over 100,000 people to do just that.
The key is that your breath is directly linked to your emotions.

This 1-Hour Restorative Session Includes:
-Open, safe space for sharing and self-care for Black people
-Facilitated discussion
-Breath work and meditation

Led by Black facilitators, certified in stress and trauma relief.

**Source:** AVL_TODAY

**Tags:** new-years-eve, funk-soul, jam-band, neo-soul, club-venue

**Score:** 20/30 (Rarity: 7, Unique: 7, Magnitude: 6)
**Score Reason:** NYE is a one-night, limited-date draw (higher rarity). A Chicago funk-soul jam band offering a groove-driven late-night dance party is fun and distinctive but not wildly novel. Playing Asheville Music Hall gives it a solid regional draw without being a national headliner.

**AI Summary:** Delivering groove-driven funk-soul jams that fuse neo-soul, hip-hop beats, and rock energy for a late-night dance party.

### Description

Born out of the vibrant Chicago music scene, Sneezy is a funk-soul jam band that knows no boundaries. Rooted in lifelong friendships and a shared love for collaboration, the band seamlessly blends funk grooves, neo-soul rhythms, hip-hop beats, and rock energy into a sound uniquely their own. With deep ties to their Libertyville upbringing just north of the Windy City, Sneezy’s music is a love letter to Chicago’s rich musical heritage, echoing its soul, grit, and collective spirit.

Led by the magnetic voices of Brett O’Connor (lead vocals, harmonica) and Jack Holland (vocals, acoustic guitar), and powered by the dynamic talents of Austin Lutter (electric guitar, background vocals), Danny Bauer (keys, background vocals), Austin Koziol (drums, background vocals), Destiny Pivonka (saxophone, vocals), and Tom “Chops” Hannum (bass), Sneezy thrives on the alchemy of their diverse influences. Their music, recorded in places like Asheville’s Echo Mountain Studios, overflows with joy, introspection, and an undeniable groove, capturing the heart of their hard-earned adventures.

Known for turning every stage into a “living room,” their live shows are immersive, soulful celebrations where audiences become collaborators and music becomes shared catharsis. Whether it’s a raucous jam or a tender ballad, Sneezy creates music that connects, comforts, and moves.

**Score:** 23/30 (Rarity: 9, Unique: 7, Magnitude: 7)

Purchase Tickets: https://www.etix.com/ticket/servlet/s/38219841

Welcome to the world of ElectroLust!

ELECTROLUST is Asheville’s electro-funk renegade supergroup, bending electronic music with soul, funk, R&B, hip-hop, and world influences into a sweat-soaked groove built for late nights and loud rooms. Sleek, raw, and unapologetically future-facing, they’re stepping into a new era with their signature production turned all the way up—locking in the kind of sound that shakes dance floors and keeps crowds hooked till sunrise.

At the core of Electro Lust beats the hearts of Grammy Award-winning artists from Asheville, NC's musical scene - Members of Yo Mama’s Big Fat Booty Band, The Fritz, Empire Strikes Brass, & Marcus King Band

Step into the soundwaves of Electro Lust, and suddenly you're whisked away, careening from the neon-lit confines of a Miami nightclub, drifting to the sun-soaked sands of a Brazilian beach, and finally landing amidst the vibrant chaos of Cuban streets. All the while, the soundtrack to this journey is an eclectic hip-hop mix tape, a melodic manifesto that defies convention and invites you to lose yourself in the raw energy of the Electro Lust experience. Strap in and let the music guide you through this electrifying tapestry of sound and sensation.

AUSPICIOUS GOLDEN FISH
Swimming in an ocean of sound, Auspicious Golden Fish weaves together searing guitar riffs, hypnotic synth textures, and deep funk grooves into a transcendent musical experience. Guitarist/producer Jamie Hendrickson (The Fritz/ElectroLust) assembles a revolving lineup of all-star musicians that bring his compositions to life. The result is a sonic journey—one that invites listeners to dissolve the ego, embrace the present moment, and dance into higher states of consciousness.

**Score:** 17/30 (Rarity: 7, Unique: 6, Magnitude: 4)
**Score Reason:** A one-night New Year’s Eve pub show is a missable annual event (rarity 7). High-energy, danceable local rock brings good party vibes but isn’t deeply novel (unique 6). Hosted in an intimate Jack of the Wood setting with a local draw, so scale is modest (magnitude 4).

Jacob Rodriguez's world-traveling baritone sax brings the perfect soundtrack for crossing into a new year, channeling stories through reed and breath that connect all the places you've been to all the places you're going. Quinn Sternberg anchors this New Year's Eve sonic revival with bass lines that don't just walk into the future-they dance, transforming the countdown into gravitational grooves that make every moment before midnight feel sanctified. Joe Enright treats his drum kit like a time machine, his sticks weaving rhythmic narratives that bridge 2025's mountain memories with 2026's metropolitan possibilities, while Alex Taub's piano becomes both reflection and resolution, finding those sacred spaces between what was and what could be where musical miracles happen. Andy Page completes this New Year's congregation with guitar work that's traveled from Switzerland to Japan, bringing two decades of celebration wisdom to help Asheville ring in the new year with style. At Little Jumbo Bar, where the walls themselves seem to lean in when real music is being born, prepare for a New Year's Eve where the soul jazz tradition gets resurrected not through nostalgia, but through five musicians who know that the best way to celebrate time passing is to make every moment swing. Forget the ball drop-this is how you step into 2026. \*Some countdowns don't need clocks-just musicians who make every beat matter.

**Score:** 12/30 (Rarity: 5, Unique: 4, Magnitude: 3)
**Score Reason:** An annual New Year’s Day group walk — seasonal and easy to miss if you don’t plan for Jan 1 (rarity 5). Low on novelty (standard community fitness/dog-friendly walk) but pleasant and inclusive (unique 4). Small local draw run by walking groups and AARP, likely dozens rather than a regional crowd (magnitude 3). Free, paved routes and moderate difficulty make it a solid local option.

**AI Summary:** Featuring 7 km and 10 km paved route options through the urban trail, with hills, stairs, and dog-friendly pacing.

### Description

We are joining the Asheville Amblers Walking Club, Stryder, AARP, and perhaps some others, for this walk. Dress for the weather.

There are some hills and stairs, but this walk is nearly all on pavement. Tennis shoes are fine, but some may want walking sticks. This walk would not be good for wheelchairs and would be rather difficult for strollers. Dogs on leash would be ok.

As always, bring water and a protein snack.

Enjoy portions of the Urban Trail through the vibrant art deco downtown and the ambience of a designated "All American City". Visit the Grove Arcade with shops and restaurants to depict its original uniqueness as an indoor shopping mall back in the 1920s. Walk by the Thomas Wolfe Home, well known author of *Look Homeward, Angel* and *You Can't Go Home Again*. Visit several old neighborhoods of Asheville and the Greenway along Reed Creek. Meander through the historic Montford District with old homes and B&Bs. Ramble through Riverside Cemetery where O. Henry (author of "The Gift of the Magi") and Thomas Wolfe are buried.

We will register at 12:30 in the parking lot behind the Asheville Chamber of Commerce Visitors Center. The Visitors Center will be closed, so we suggest taking care of any personal needs just prior to arrival.

The walk is free, although donations to the Amblers would be accepted ($4 suggested). Step-off will be at 1:00. Choose between a 7 KM/4 mile and a 10 KM/6 mile version of the walk. The walk will be guided by experienced group walking leaders.

**Organizer:** The Asheville Hiking Group

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP

**Tags:** Outdoors, Community, beginner friendly, stony trail, creek and gorge views, out-and-back, group meetup

**Score:** 13/30 (Rarity: 6, Unique: 4, Magnitude: 3)
**Score Reason:** A one-off New Year–week group hike (sign-up opens Dec 28) — more missable than a weekly staple but not a true one-time spectacle. Nice creek-and-gorge setting gives some character, but it’s a small, local/community draw rather than a regional or headline event.

**AI Summary:** Featuring a nearly flat, 7.2-mile out-and-back hike along creek rapids to the French Broad confluence.

### Description

**Sign-up opens Sunday, December 28th, at 8:00 PM.**

***HAPPY 2026!***

This out-and-back hike northwest of Asheville is a spectacular stroll along the picturesque Big Laurel Creek. You'll see many beautiful views of the creek's rapids, pools, and gorges along the way.

We'll take the trail all the way to its terminus at the confluence of Big Laurel Creek and the French Broad River. There, we'll pause for around a 15-minute break before heading back.

The trail is nearly flat, but rather stony and rooted in places. Hiking poles are advisable if you might feel unsteady. There are around a half-dozen trivial stream crossings, and there may be some muddy spots here and there along the route.

We'll do a steady 2.3-ish mph pace. I'd put the difficulty level at 3/10.

Well-behaved dogs are welcome on-leash. Wear sensible hiking boots. Bring some water and a snack or lunch if you'd like.

**CARPOOLING TIME & PLACE**

We'll carpool from the **Weaverville Publix Supermarket** and leave there at **9:30 AM** sharp, so *come a few minutes early*. It's at **165 Weaver Blvd.**, Weaverville. **Exit 19B from I-26.** We'll gather at the **west end of the lot**, which is to the left as you face the store. (Look for me and my silver Hyundai sedan.) It'll be a 25-minute drive to the trailhead. We'll be back at Publix by roughly 1:30 PM.

**[Weaverville Publix on Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/Dw3KEb5oZP2dSVBR7)**
https://goo.gl/maps/Dw3KEb5oZP2dSVBR7

If you plan to meet us at the trailhead, please post a comment or message me, and arrive by 10:00. The parking lot is at "Big Laurel Trailhead" on Rt. 25/70 just before it turns into Rt. 208.

### Description

A Connection Practice is a meeting to practice your skills in listening and connecting with others. No conversation topic is off limits. The only objective of the meeting is to feel a genuine sense of connection by the time it's over, and the only rule is that we promise to not give each other advice.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates.

We can be chatty and interactive or leave you to be hyper-focused in your zone while surrounded by other creatives. Stay the whole time or drop in and out.

## Fairlight and the Magick

**Location:** Highland Brewing Company, 12 Old Charlotte Hwy, Ste 200, Asheville, NC

**Organizer:** Highland Brewing Company

**Price:** Unknown

**Source:** AVL_TODAY

**Tags:** Live Music, Beer, soulful vocals, original music, brewery show, jam-formed band

**Score:** 11/30 (Rarity: 2, Unique: 5, Magnitude: 4)
**Score Reason:** Local original indie-rock band at Highland Brewing — a common brewery gig (low missability), pleasant soulful/roots vibe (moderately fun/unique), and a small-to-mid local draw rather than a regional headliner.

**AI Summary:** Showcasing soulful, powerful lead vocals backed by gritty, roots-tinged indie-rock arrangements.

### Description

The origin story of Fairlight and the Magick is pretty mundane and hardly uncommon. The band came together through connections made though informal jams, broken-up bands and a Craigslist ad.  The pieces started coming together in the aftermath of Helene.  The members of the band came from all directions; Chicago, Florida, Colorado and Charlotte to make Western North Carolina their home.   Once the band members were all in the same room, the power and soulfulness of Fairlight’s voice was astonishing. The mission of the band was clear; to develop and sound and style to fit Fairlight’s amazing talent. The first thing that became apparent was the rhythm section of Jeff Rubin on drums and Walter Anderson on bass brings a high level of skill, feeling and groove to whatever they play. Whether the song is a slow blues, driving rock, funky or soulful—there is always a deep pocket there. David Harris on guitar brings a gritty, driven, psychedelic blues sound to the band, but also plays with a sense of melody when the song calls for it.   As a band, Fairlight and the Magick plays with tons of feeling and soul!

## Sensory Immersion Night  with Senseful Wellness

**Source:** MEETUP

**Tags:** Wellness, Spiritual, Education, LGBTQ+, neurodivergent friendly, donation based, mindfulness workshop, sensory exploration, holistic healing

**Score:** 9/30 (Rarity: 2, Unique: 5, Magnitude: 2)
**Score Reason:** A donation-based, local sensory-wellness workshop at a small venue — niche and welcoming (neurodivergent/LGBTQ+ friendly) but clearly recurring and a hyper-local draw rather than a one-off or big headliner.

**AI Summary:** Exploring immersive sensory practices to recalibrate the nervous system and restore mind-body connection.

### Description

**Sensory Immersion Night**
Have you explored sensory Exploration for your nervous system?
Our senses have a beautiful way of grounding us into the present moment but this can take some work. Our sensory world can also become disconnected when our nervous system has stayed in pattern loops from high levels of stress and/or trauma.

This is essentially a disconnect of mind and body. The sensory information we receive from the outside world, drives movement patterns in the body. So, if we’re constantly perceiving the world as unsafe, we will move in that way.

**How do we begin to correct this?**
We start the practice of reintegrating the senses. Meditating can be challenging when we’ve been in a heightened state, so exploring adding additional sensory input can help to get you out of attachment to your busy racing thoughts and into the feelings/sensations created in your body. The more you explore the five traditional senses more mindfully, the more you can perceive energy. The more energy you perceive, the more you feel connected to everything. Learning to express and move energy is vulnerable, but as the research shows, vulnerability is the key to personal freedom.

This evening will be all about tuning in and listening to your needs. This is a neurodivergent friendly space that honors consent and personal preferences.

**What to expect:**
mindful sensory exploration
stations to explore various sensory techniques
group meditation with added sensory input
Donation only/pay what you can

**Senseful Wellness & Yoga** is a Queer owned company created in 2020 as a way to expand the concept of healing beyond the borders of the established systems and boxes of the healthcare world.

**Tags:** Wellness, Community, platonic intimacy, non-sexual, consent-first, group cuddle, ticketed rsvp

**Score:** 15/30 (Rarity: 5, Unique: 7, Magnitude: 3)
**Score Reason:** Niche, consent-first group cuddling is a high-concept, wellness-driven experience that feels special and inclusive but is a small, local community event (ticketed RSVP) rather than a regional or touring draw; timing just after New Year gives modest urgency.

**AI Summary:** Facilitating consent-focused, non-sexual group cuddling to explore platonic intimacy in a respectful, inclusive setting.

### Description

Please note- If you want to attend this event you need to purchase a ticket- We advertise in many places and only paid tickets will reserve your space.[ ](https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/jan-2nd-community-cuddles)**[Click HERE to register!](https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/jan-2nd-community-cuddles)**

**This is a non-sexual touch based event that invites participants to explore platonic intimacy in a safe environment** with like-minded people. We respect personal boundaries and through a supportive framework of mutual agreements that maximize safety and create a space of easy openness and compassionate connection.
At this event we have the chance to normalize touch with clear boundaries; this is a space for respectful, consent-based touch. We allow ourselves to be seen. We have fun.
We welcome people of all backgrounds, genders, ethnicities, relationship styles, sexualities, sizes, and ages (18+).

**THE RULES**
1\. Clothes stay on for the whole event\.
2\. You do not have to touch anyone at this event\.
3\. You must receive a verbal YES before you touch anyone\.
4\. Take care of yourself and those you choose to interact with\.
5\. Speak up if you have a question\, concern\, or if you need assistance with anything during the event\.
6\. All emotions are welcome\- we love vulnerability\.
**WHY CUDDLE?**
Touch is a basic human need, and many of us do not get enough; most people don’t even know they are missing touch, or have a way to ask for touch without sexualizing it. We believe deeply in the power of touch, and the importance of communication and consent in creating a safe space for touch.
CUDDLING WITH STRANGERS
Cuddling with strangers sounds weird or scary to most people. “Will I like it?” “What if someone wants to touch me and I don’t want to?” “What if I say yes and it’s not what I want?” “What if I really want to touch someone and they say no?” These are all normal questions. The answer is that this is a space created to ask for exactly what you w...

**Score:** 13/30 (Rarity: 2, Unique: 7, Magnitude: 4)
**Score Reason:** Weekly Asheville Movement Collective ecstatic dance (low missability). High-concept, facilitated ecstatic dance with a guest DJ and opening circle gives strong ‘main character’ energy. Community-level draw — a professional local event rather than a regional/national headliner.

## Synthesizer Sound Bath

**Date:** Friday, January 2, 2026 at 7:00 PM

**Location:** The Well, 3 Louisiana Avenue, Asheville

**Price:** $15

**Source:** MOUNTAIN_X

**Tags:** Wellness, Spiritual, sound bath, analog synthesizer, quadraphonic, crystal singing bowls, meditation

**Score:** 14/30 (Rarity: 4, Unique: 7, Magnitude: 3)
**Score Reason:** A local wellness session at The Well on Jan 2 — not a once‑in‑a-lifetime date and there are many similar sound baths nearby, so it isn’t highly missable (rarity 4). The analog synth + crystal bowls in a quadraphonic array is a distinctive, high‑concept take on sound baths (unique 7). However it’s a small, local draw at an intimate venue with a local artist, so magnitude is modest (3).

**AI Summary:** Blending analog synths and crystal bowls into a quadraphonic ambient sound journey for deep relaxation.

### Description

Composer and sound designer Logos, aka James Genaro, will take you on a meditative musical experience, blending analog synthesizers and acoustic instruments (crystal singing bowls, bells, gongs and more) in a quadraphonic speaker array.

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MOUNTAIN_X

**Tags:** appalachian folk, singer-songwriter, acoustic, brewery show, intimate

**Score:** 11/30 (Rarity: 3, Unique: 5, Magnitude: 3)
**Score Reason:** Free, intimate Appalachian roots-folk set at One World Brewing — a cozy local brewery gig. Solid fireside singer‑songwriter vibe but very typical of recurring brewery/residency/open‑mic programming in Asheville, not a major touring or large‑scale draw.

**AI Summary:** Showcasing intimate Appalachian roots-folk with heartfelt, fireside storytelling and acoustic songs inspired by mountain and river life.

### Description

Somewhere between the outdoors and the stage, there’s a place so familiar and much like home. My heart lives there. And my music is from that same place. The one where the fire burns all night and the smiles and laughter just seems to erupt from. The walk we all share, regardless of our differences, is my inspiration. Myself, I’m a river boy and a mountain man of the Appalachian. I am a native of Catawba County. I look forward to bringing a little peace from my neck of the woods up the mountain to share with all you lovely folks. My influences range modern to classic with a BIG touch of soul woven into the mix. I look forward to sharing a night of local brews and tunes with all you sweet souls.

**Score:** 16/30 (Rarity: 6, Unique: 6, Magnitude: 4)
**Score Reason:** One-night Simon & Garfunkel tribute by veteran local musicians at the intimate White Horse — high-appeal, harmony-rich show but a small, local draw rather than a major touring act.

**AI Summary:** Showcasing three veteran musicians delivering acoustic, harmony-rich interpretations of classic 1960s folk-rock songs.

### Description

Take a trip back in time with composer, musician, band leader, singer and producer, Jonathan Pearlman (My Magnificent Nemesis, Alien Music Club), Blues Chanteuse Peggy Ratusz (Daddy LongLegs Blues Band, Love is a Rose Celebration of Linda Ronstadt, Love Bubble) and multi-instrumentalist, James Kylen (My Magnificent Nemesis, Here Comes the Sun: A celebration of the Beatles) as they celebrate the enduring magic of Simon & Garfunkel. At White Horse Black Mountain, we believe music is meant to be shared by all. Some households may only be able to give a little, while others may be able to give more to pay it forward and support neighbors. Each event includes a “suggested price” that reflects the normal cost of the show, but no matter what you contribute, you’re helping keep the music alive for our whole community.

**Score:** 12/30 (Rarity: 3, Unique: 5, Magnitude: 4)

**AI Summary:** Delivering danceable American-roots grooves with rich harmonies and a warm, good-time barroom vibe.

### Description

**Tags:** hot jazz, swing, cocktail-bar show, intimate venue

**Score:** 12/30 (Rarity: 3, Unique: 5, Magnitude: 4)
**Score Reason:** Late-night hot-jazz set at an intimate cocktail bar — lively and danceable but part of a common local jazz/nightlife circuit, modest regional draw and affordable cover, not a one-off touring headliner.

**AI Summary:** Delivering uptempo, horn-driven hot jazz sets ideal for late-night dancing and barroom energy.

**Tags:** roots rock, folk, trio, original songs, storytelling

**Score:** 12/30 (Rarity: 3, Unique: 5, Magnitude: 4)

### Description

## Walk Biltmore Estate's Deer Park Trail on National Chocolate Covered Cherry Day

**Date:** Saturday, January 3, 2026 at 12:00 PM

**Location:** Biltmore, 1 Lodge St, Asheville, NC

**Organizer:** Haywood County Walking Meetup Group

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP

**Tags:** Outdoors, Community, biltmore, deer park trail, nature walk, walking meetup, scenic

**Score:** 11/30 (Rarity: 3, Unique: 5, Magnitude: 3)
**Score Reason:** A free, beginner-friendly group walk on the scenic Biltmore Deer Park Trail — pleasant and slightly more special because of the Biltmore setting and the holiday tie-in, but it's a routine meetup-style walk (common recurring format) with a local/community draw rather than a major headliner.

**AI Summary:** Exploring scenic Deer Park and Garden trails on a beginner-friendly group walk with route guidance and organizer support.

### Description

Travel past the Biltmore House toward Antler Hill Village. Park in the first available area just past the Lagoon. We will access the Deer Park Trail from there. (I will be monitoring the Comments section of this walk page and also Meetup messages. If you get confused or lost, contact me right away.)

Deer Park Trail goes through the Deer Park (though it isn't near Lioncrest and the other DeerPark facilities). It comes to a T intersection. We will go right to where you can access the Garden Trails. Then we will turn around and go up the hill to the South Terrace of the Biltmore House. From there we will retrace our steps to the start point. It is about 2.5 miles round trip, or so says the map.

I've done this walk in both tennis shoes and in light hiking boots (from a different start point). I'll probably bring walking poles for the hill, though most of the walk won't need them.

Bring plenty of water and a protein snack. Dress for the weather; consider a hat and sunscreen. Dogs are welcome. Trail strollers would probably work.

PS: It being National Chocolate Covered Cherry Day, we just might enjoy a box of cherries at the end of the walk!!

**AI Summary:** Featuring a clearing crystal gong sound bath with a brief astrology overview to relax and reset the nervous system.

### Description

Join us for a relaxing sound bath meditation led by David Heiss, Master gong player and sound healing musician. David has been playing gongs and facilitating sound healing journeys since 2012. You can learn more about his work at [​https://starsounds.love](https://www.starsounds.love/)

Leave the week's stress behind as you relax and reset your nervous system with this special clearing crystal gong bath.

We will begin with a brief overview of the current astrology aspects in our sky. Then enjoy a powerful yet relaxing 45 min. gong meditation followed by an integration.

When the gong sings, you listen. You listen listens with every cell of your body. You hear it and feel it. You begin to sense more. The obscure sounds leave your brain guessing and eventually surrenders to the soundwave as you begin to relax, feel and heal. The vibrational frequencies can awaken stagnant energy. The experience is like a personal dream. There are moments during a gong meditation where the subconscious can become more conscious, where illumination and insight follows.

Suggested donations for this event are $20-40. Donations can be made at the event via cash or Venmo.

Please bring any comfort items you may desire: blankets, pillows, bolsters, eye mask, etc. We do not yet have enough community items for everyone.

* The event is from 4:30 - 6 p.m.

**AI Summary:** Exploring surrealist roots through intimate salon-style brainstorming, shared potluck, and collaborative performative experiments.

### Description

With the new year upon us, it is time for the Surreal Sirkus to return to our roots: indeed to the roots of surrealism itself. 

While the spectacle and theatrics of the big productions is how we draw the audience into our world, it is in the small interactions between ourselves that that world is created: the brainstorming sessions, the potluck... the salon. 

This was true for the OG surrealists, who would gather at the apartment of André and Simone Breton in Paris in the 1920s to discuss art, philosophy, and politics, share creative ideas, and play surrealist games — exercises in creating art by accessing the unconscious mind. 

Surreal Sirkus invites you to come take part in a similar salon, as we start to dream the next chapters of our collective story. 

If you feel so called, bring a song or a story or a poem or performance to share. At the very least be prepared to participate in some games. And of course, bring your imagination!

And bring a beverage or snack to share. 

Donations are not required, but are welcome to help support the space.

**We hope you will come meet some of the group** this coming **Sunday morning** **(10AM - noon)** or some time soon. We meet every Sunday at **Earth Fare's cafe** for just conversation among like-minded non-believers.
In addition, two Sundays per month we also have a **Book Club** that meets at **Standard Pizza on Biltmore**. We also have Wednesday evening meetings at either **Boodas Brewing or Trailside in Hendersonville** once a month. You should receive emails about each of those events and are welcome to attend.
Please sign up here in Meetup to receive notices about our activities. There are no dues. Thanks!

Our newly-formed group has 100+ members already. Our conversation groups are usually 10-15 people and have been excellent. We chat about atheism, but also about **other things that are not related to religion** etc at all.

**None of us believe in religion.** Some of us wonder if "the universe" or something energy-related affects our lives, while others feel that someday science will be able to explain time-without-beginning and other mysteries.

**Until further notice our Sunday get togethers will be 10AM - noon** at the **cafe at Earth Fare.** RSVP is requested but not required.

The address is **66 Westgate Pkwy, Asheville**. **Earth Fare** is a large and excellent "health supermarket". It's in the Westgate Shopping Center, which is right off Patton after crossing the bridge on 240 West. Earth Fare is at the far end of the parking lot. There is plenty of free parking. They have a **very nice cafe** that you'll find off to the left after entering the store. The grocery area also has some good deals - see https://www.earthfare.com/#about

We’ll have a sign so you can see what table(s) we are using. Bringing kids and dogs is not recommended.

Because we appreciate each participant, **suggestions and input are welcome**. Let's start with **your input** about these things...

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates.

**Organizer:** Asheville Creativity Journaling Meetup Group

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP

**Tags:** Art, Wellness, Spiritual, Education, Community

**Score:** 9/30 (Rarity: 2, Unique: 5, Magnitude: 2)
**Score Reason:** Free community journaling + meditation session at a local hotel — a niche creative/spiritual meetup that’s recurring and easy to miss but has modest, small-group local draw.

**AI Summary:** Exploring journaling and meditation to access inner creative voices and gently nurture emerging songs.

### Description

* **We’ll explore the use of journaling and meditation in creative work. We’ll nurture the song within and see what that shy inner voice wants to tell us. It is about listening first – sensing what wants to become. This is a forum where artists can drop beneath the busy surface mind and listen for what's trying to emerge.**

**There are moments in our lives, there are moments in a day, when we seem to see beyond the usual--become clairvoyant. We reach then into reality. Such are the moments of our greatest happiness. Such are the moments of our greatest vision....At such times there is a song going on within us, a song to which we listen. It fills us with surprise. We marvel at it. We would continue to hear it. But few are capable of holding themselves in the state of listening to their song. Intellectuality steps in and as the song within us is of the utmost sensitiveness, it retires in the presence of the cold, material intellect. It is aristocratic and will not associate itself with the commonplace--and we fall back and become our ordinary selves. Yet we live in the memory of these songs which in moments of intellectual inadvertence have been possible to us. They are the pinnacles of our experience and it is the desire to express these intimate sensations, this song from within, which motivates the masters of all art.**

## NEW DATE: Book Club: Why People Believe Weird Things, by Michael Shermer

**Date:** Sunday, January 4, 2026 at 4:00 PM

**Location:** Standard Pizza, 755 Biltmore Ave., Asheville, NC

**Organizer:** Atheists of WNC

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP

**Tags:** Networking, Dining, Book Club

**Score:** 8/30 (Rarity: 2, Unique: 4, Magnitude: 2)
**Score Reason:** A small, recurring local book-club meetup (not a one-off) in a pizza-place back room — niche topic (Shermer/pseudoscience) gives modest ‘cool’ but it’s low-impact and hyper-local.

**AI Summary:** Exploring chapters 9–11 of Shermer’s examination of pseudoscience through a small-group, discussion-focused meeting.

### Description

**Our next meeting** is **Sunday, January 4, 4 p.m. at Standard Pizza, 755 Biltmore Avenue in Asheville**.

Look for us inside, in the back room.

We will continue our discussion of ***Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time***, by science writer [Michael Shermer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Shermer). We will focus on Part three, chapters 9 to 11, which is around 45 pages.

From the forward: "Unless we regularly use human reason both to discover and acknowledge nature's factuality, and to follow the logical implications for efficacious human action that such knowledge entails, we will lose out to the frightening forces of irrationality, romanticism, uncompromising "true"belief, and the apparent resulting inevitability of mob action. Skepticism is the agent of reason against organized irrationalism and is therefore one of the keys to human social and civic decency."

Note: Each section stands alone and is prime for discussion, so newcomers are welcome!
We would like to keep each meeting to a max of 10 people. **Please RSVP** if you do plan to come.

Referred to as "Introvert's Happy Hour", Silent Book clubs allow readers to engage with each other without the commitment of reading a shared title.

**How does it work?**
For the first 15-30 mins we will gather, grab our food and drink and engage in introductions. Feel free to discuss your recent favorites, mention a title that lives in your head rent free, or ask for recommendations!

The Core represents everything essential about Asheville's jazz DNA distilled into five musicians who understand that the best ensembles aren't just collections of individual talents-they're alchemical reactions where individual voices merge into something greater than their sum. This quintet embodies the mountain city's unique musical ecosystem, where Blue Ridge authenticity meets sophisticated harmonic exploration, where the intimacy of local venues allows for the kind of musical risk-taking that transforms standards into personal statements. Named for their ability to get to the heart of every song they touch, The Core strips away musical pretense to reveal the emotional architecture beneath, proving that jazz at its best isn't about showing off-it's about showing up completely for each moment, each phrase, each possibility that emerges when five musicians breathe together in perfect musical democracy. In Asheville's thriving jazz scene, The Core stands as both inheritors of tradition and pioneers of what's next, reminding audiences that the most profound musical experiences happen when virtuosity serves vulnerability, when technique becomes the vehicle for something infinitely more human.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates. All connection practices are free of charge.

This quartet embodies the philosophical concept of quintessence-the fifth element beyond earth, air, fire, and water-representing the fundamental substance from which all musical reality springs. Their original compositions crystallize the essential qualities of diverse influences, oscillating between through-composed musical themes, groove-based soul explorations, traditional jazz-influenced pieces, Americana-inspired peaceful melodicism, world music influences, free jazz adventures, and occasional forays into cacophonous noise music. Through years of improvisational study, they've learned to access that rarefied space where genres dissolve into pure creative energy. In this musical laboratory, Sanders' guitar becomes a conduit for universal vibration, Boyd's reeds channel the breath of consciousness itself, Page's bass provides the fundamental frequency of existence, while Hall's percussion creates the rhythmic heartbeat of the cosmos.

**AI Summary:** Building confidence and basic alignment through slow-paced, 75-minute classes designed for absolute beginners.

### Description

This 5-week series is for absolute beginners as well as anyone who wants to cultivate a beginner’s mind. **We will move at a beginner’s pace, with no yogi left behind.** If you’ve been thinking about practicing yoga and want to develop a movement practice that is more than just exercise, this is your invitation to dive in and **start yoga now**. Each 75-min class covers the basics to give students the confidence and knowledge to join any of our all-level classes. 

Students explore a variety of poses and series, from standing to supine, twists, forward bends and backbends, and even beginning inversions. You’ll gain more strength and flexibility while alleviating pain, and learn how to manage stress more effectively with simple breathing practices and Heartfull® Meditation techniques. 

**And because sometimes doing new things by yourself can be intimidating, we’ve got a special offer for two who sign up together.** For any two folks who want to come to class together (friends, spouses, siblings, partners) we’ve got a special deal of two for $145. If you’d like to sign up for yourself and another student, simply purchase the **Start Yoga Now for 2** pass and then send us an email with the name of the other student and we’ll take care of registration for them.

**Letitia** has been teaching yoga for almost 20 years, and some of her favorite students to work with are total beginners stepping on to the mat for the first time. She loves demystifying both yoga poses and yoga philosophy by deconstructing complex concepts and movements into simple, accessible pieces. When you study with Letitia, you learn the point of the poses, the basic actions of the poses, and how to practice the pose for your body in a way that is effective while encouraging growth and change.

*Please note: While this series is designed for beginners, it is not suitable for those recovering from recent surgeries (such as knee replacement or rotator cuff repair), or for students who rely on mobility ai...

### Description

Shut Up & Write!

**Here's how it works.** Show up at or before 6:00. At 6:00, we do some quick introductions. Afterward, for a full 60 minutes (I'll set a timer!) we are heads-down writing. Writing what? A novel? You bet. Some poetry? Sure. Song lyrics? Your resume? That report you need to get to your boss before 8 AM or you'll *need* *to write* that resume? All of the above and more. Just shut up and write.

Surrounding ourselves with other writers who are busy putting words onto page (physical or virtual) keeps us all accountable and focused.

When the timer goes off, we'll check-in with each other and see how it went. Afterward, feel free to stay to chat and get to know your fellow writers, or keep writing, or take off.

Socializing is optional and will happen after (or briefly before) the focused writing. This is a safe space to work on your craft. No one will read or critique your writing.

For more information about our events, visit [https://shutupwrite.com](https://shutupwrite.com).

**What to Expect**

* Roughly 15 minutes of introductions
* 60 minutes of focused writing (somebody set a timer)!
* Afterward, optional socializing

**Being late is okay:** Just show up and get settled, then check in with the host after the session. (Look for the person with the Shut Up & Write sign).

**What Should I Bring?**

* Whatever you need to be able to write!
* Earbuds/earplugs if you want to block ambient noise.

**Other Important Details:**

HOSTS: This is a multi-host event, so most of the time there will be a host present. If we are unlucky and no host can attend, please find each other and self-organize. Pay attention to the event chat and comments to see who is available.

WI-FI: Yes!

PARKING: Street parking in metered spots is free after 6pm. Closest municipal garages ($2/hour) are Wall St. & Coxe Street/Sears Alley.

This first session is designed to be collaborative. Instead of a formal workshop, we’ll use our time to build a community-generated list of future topics and skill-building sessions.

Our goal is to create an ongoing series of discussions and workshops shaped by the needs and interests of the group.

The essential oil blends, which are thoughtfully handcrafted by Katie with intention and artistry, are available for purchase after the workshop for you to continue your connection with their guidance and support as you move into 2026.

**Date:** Tuesday, January 6, 2026 at 6:00 PM

**Location:** Rad Brewing Co, 13 Mystery St., Asheville, NC

**Organizer:** AVL Digital Nomads

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP

**Tags:** Book Club, Community, Education

**Score:** 12/30 (Rarity: 4, Unique: 5, Magnitude: 3)
**Score Reason:** Monthly-style community book club at a brewery focused on a local author and planning future picks — pleasant niche meetup for digital nomads but easily missable and a small, hyper-local draw.

**AI Summary:** Discussing a local-author literary novel while planning the next six months of selections with a digital-nomad crowd.

### Description

**January Selection - *Even As We Breathe* by Annette Clapsaddle (local author)**

+ Bring your book suggestions for planning. We’ll plan out the next 6 months of selections.

Even As We Breathe invokes the elements of bone, blood, and flesh as Cowney navigates difficult social, cultural, and ethnic divides. After leaving the seclusion of the Cherokee reservation, he is able to explore a future free from the consequences of his family's choices and to construct a new worldview, for a time. However, prejudice and persecution in the white world of the resort eventually compel Cowney to free himself from larger forces that hold him back as he struggles to unearth evidence of his innocence and clear his name.

**Welcome** to our robust and engaging Book Club! We're a small, friendly group dedicated to fostering lively discussions about our monthly book selections. Whether you've read the entire book, just a few chapters, or even if you're simply curious about the title, we'd love to have you join us!

**Book Selection:** We encourage active participation in choosing our reading material. During each meeting, members have the opportunity to suggest and vote on the next book. Feel free to post your book recommendations in the comments section as well - we're always excited to explore new literary adventures!

**Meeting Schedule**: We gather on the First Tuesday of every month for our book discussions.
What sets us apart is our small group size and directed discussions. This intimate setting allows for deeper, more engaging conversations where everyone's voice can be heard. It's the perfect environment for those who love to dive deep into themes, characters, and the intricacies of storytelling.

So whether you're a seasoned bookworm or just dipping your toes into the world of literature, we invite you to join us. Let's explore new worlds, challenge our perspectives, and forge new friendships - one book at a time!

**February Pick: *TBD***

Sanders, Boyd, Page & Hall distill the pure essence of improvisational expression, converging as alchemists of sound, transmuting musical elements into their most essential forms. This quartet embodies the philosophical concept of quintessence—the fifth element beyond earth, air, fire, and water—representing the fundamental substance from which all musical reality springs. Their original compositions crystallize the essential qualities of diverse influences, oscillating between through-composed musical themes, groove-based soul explorations, traditional jazz-influenced pieces, Americana-inspired peaceful melodicism, world music influences, free jazz adventures, and occasional forays into cacophonous noise music. Through years of improvisational study, they've learned to access that rarefied space where genres dissolve into pure creative energy. In this musical laboratory, Sanders' guitar becomes a conduit for universal vibration, Boyd's reeds channel the breath of consciousness itself, Page's bass provides the fundamental frequency of existence, while Hall's percussion creates the rhythmic heartbeat of the cosmos. Will Boyd - Sax, Flute, Clarinet, EWI Zack Page - Acoustic & Electric Bass Alan Hall - Drums Jay Sanders - Guitar and Effects Every Monday and Tuesday, Little Jumbo brings live jazz to your ears. littlejumbobar.com “Simply put, Little Jumbo should be at the top of your list of places for cocktails in Asheville.

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates.

**AI Summary:** Showcasing four curated songwriter sets with intimate storytelling and a surprise guest collaboration.

### Description

The Songwriters Roller Derby Showcase, presented by the Asheville Songwriters Association, is a quarterly music show with no roller skates included – just four performers “rollin’ out the songs, elbows-n-all.” Curated and hosted by Thomas Kozak and Jodi John Pippin, each “Derby Night” at The Grey Eagle will showcase the craft of songwriting in an intimate and welcoming setting. As an added element of the Songwriters Roller Derby Showcase, a surprise guest will join the performers on stage for interactive, on-the-spot commentary ~ a “look under the hood of the songwriting process” of sorts. The audience will have a chance to share comments as well, if they are inspired to do so. For most of the evening, the songwriters will perform finished songs, but they will also each share a brand new song that has not yet been performed on stage. Come support the songwriters as they show their vulnerable side and help nurture the art and craft of songwriting in the region and beyond.

**Tags:** Wellness, Community, listening practice, facilitated group, emotional connection, no-advice rule, peer support

**Score:** 5/30 (Rarity: 1, Unique: 2, Magnitude: 2)
**Score Reason:** Weekly recurring event - happens every week.

**AI Summary:** Practicing deep listening through facilitated exercises to build genuine, non-advice peer connection.

### Description

A Connection Practice is a meeting to practice your skills in listening and connecting with others. No conversation topic is off limits. The only objective of the meeting is to feel a genuine sense of connection by the time it's over, and the only rule is that we promise to not give each other advice.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates.

The sunny good times are going down on Friday, Jan 9th at The Grey Eagle. We're talking beach balls, tropical decorations, and most importantly, a contest for "best dressed." BEACHY ATTIRE ENCOURAGED! Tix on sale now, get 'em while they're hot (get it? hot? cause it's a summer thing?). The Get Right Band is a psychedelic indie rock group committed to relentlessly following their muses to honest self-expression, to whatever excites them and pushes them into unexplored territory, to capturing some version of truth. American Songwriter writes that the Asheville, NC based group, "filters 60's/70's psychedelia and 90's alternative rock through a modern lens-as if Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and Nirvana co-wrote an album produced by Danger Mouse and Dan Auerbach." The Get Right Band formed in 2011, built around the musical brotherhood that guitarist/singer/songwriter Silas Durocher and bassist Jesse Gentry have formed playing music together since middle school. Durocher, who is a trained composer and has been commissioned to write for symphonies and chamber groups, has guitar chops that can soothe or rage, with a charismatic swagger as frontman and singer. Gentry's virtuosic bass playing "catapults from elastic to nasty" (The Mountain Xpress). Completing the team is drummer extraordinaire Jaze Uries, who is also a singer, songwriter, producer, photographer, and DJ, and keys legend Chuck Lichtenberger, whose incredible playing has been a staple of the Asheville music scene for years. GRB has defined their sound through constant evolution, building to the hook-driven, synth-heavy pop/rock/psych band they are today. The Huffington Post writes, "their songs are infectious and take you immediately to a place. The lyrics are smart and bear weight." SUPATIGHT

## Garden Apartments // Sufferin' Fools // PJ Bond

**Date:** Friday, January 9, 2026 at 9:00 PM

**Location:** Fleetwood’s, 496 Haywood Rd, Asheville, NC

**Price:** $10

**Source:** MOUNTAIN_X

**Tags:** americana, indie folk, singer-songwriter, touring artist, bar venue

**Score:** 17/30 (Rarity: 7, Unique: 6, Magnitude: 4)
**Score Reason:** A one-night stop by a touring singer‑songwriter at Fleetwood’s — intimate, well-crafted Americana with solid appeal but a small bar‑venue draw and a fairly typical concept.

**AI Summary:** Blending introspective Americana and reverb-drenched rock through lyrically dark yet upbeat solo performances.

### Description

PJ Bond PJ Bond is a wandering songster who has traversed the American and European landscapes more times than he can easily count. He got his start over ten years ago in what was then called the DIY Indie scene, back when musicians still made money on CDs and people spent a lot of their time trying to get signed. A decade later, Bond’s lyrically dark but otherwise upbeat songs span from introspective Americana to reverb-laden rock from an earlier era. If forced to draw parallels and speak of influences, one might say he has drawn from the likes of Elliott Smith and Wilco, though he might prefer to credit Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan these days. When not traveling the globe, PJ currently lives in Asheville, NC, listening to country music, and making pizza. Sufferin' Fools The fine fellows in Sufferin' Fools congregate around the mountain made tunes of Cameron Thomas. Born and bred in the Carolinas, Thomas' songs share the humble joys, struggles and mysteries of a southern life - where it might lead you, who you meet, and what you bring back home. The band rides the dusty crossroads of Memphis country soul and Midwest power pop - kicking the dual guitars into overdrive for fun. The band's second EP, Forest for the Trees, was released on 9/26/25 and is available on all streaming platforms. Garden Apartments West Asheville trio, Garden Apartments, blend the best elements of Americana, Psych and 90's Indie Rock to create a unique but familiar sound. Tight and minimal arrangements provide the backdrop to Rustin Bragaw's immediately captivating voice, accompanied by the tasteful guitar work of Chris Pearson and the solid drumming of Daniel Hawkins. Each player brings years of recording and touring experience to the table. The trio has been playing around Asheville since late 2024 after releasing a self-titled EP, which is currently available on streaming platforms.

11:00 am Family Storytime (birth – 5 years) 11:30 am Craft Time Join us for stories, songs, movement and more as we celebrate and promote early and emergent literacy at the Transylvania County Library! Same theme and craft as Tuesday storytime. More About Early and Emergent Literacy Babies, toddlers, preschoolers, in all stages of development with their parents and caregivers are welcome to our morning of celebration. Children start to learn language from the day they are born. As they grow and develop, their speech and language skills become increasingly more complex. During early speech and language development, children learn skills that are important to the development of literacy (reading and writing). This stage, known as emergent literacy, begins at birth and continues through the preschool years. From birth, babies listen to language patterns in everyday speech, as well as in rhyming, chanting, and singing – all of these play an important part in literacy development. As they develop, children see and interact with print in everyday situations. In everything from books and magazines to grocery lists, whether at home or in preschool, they are (and should be) encountering language in print well before they start elementary school. Parents can see their child’s growing appreciation and enjoyment of print as they begin to recognize words that rhyme, scribble with crayons, point out street signs and symbols, and name some letters of the alphabet. Gradually, children combine what they know about speaking and listening with what they know about print and become ready to learn to read and write. That’s what storytime at the library is all about!

Asheville, NC — On **January 10, 2026,** the historic **YMI Cultural Center** will open *“Portraits of Dignity: Do You See Me Now?,”* a compelling new body of figurative work by Asheville-based painter **Joseph Pearson.** Steeped in empathy, social realism, and decades of artistic discipline, this exhibition invites viewers to reconsider how society sees—or fails to see—the individuals who are so often overlooked.

Rooted in close observation and an unyielding respect for humanity, *“Portraits of Dignity”* offers a profound encounter with people whom society often consigns to the periphery. Each portrait becomes a moment of connection, asking viewers to slow down, look closer, and witness the dignity, complexity, and presence of individuals too often unseen.

“These are people we see peripherally, people we pass by,” says Pearson. “Doing this work required me to truly see them—to pay attention to their eyes, their expressions, the uniqueness of who they are. The question is simple: *Do you see me now?”*

**Pearson’s mission is to open folks’ awareness to our neighbors, considered on the fringe of our communities. A portion of any sale will be donated to favorite non-profits, like Pisgah Legal Services and  MANNA Food Bank. Joseph and his wife Gael hope folks will consider doing the same if they have not already done so.**

## New Year, New You! Intentional Creativity Workshop

**Date:** Sunday, January 11, 2026 at 9:00 AM

**Location:** Asheville Masonic Temple, 80 Broadway St., Asheville, NC

**Organizer:** Asheville Masonic Temple

**Price:** $755

**Source:** AVL_TODAY

**Tags:** Art, Wellness, Education, intentional creativity, journaling, transformational workshop, multi-day, self-discovery

**Score:** 21/30 (Rarity: 8, Unique: 7, Magnitude: 6)
**Score Reason:** A pricey, 2.5-day one-off transformational workshop at a notable Asheville venue — fairly missable and feels high-concept (intentional creativity) but is a regional, niche draw rather than a national headliner.

**AI Summary:** Facilitating a deep creative reset through guided journaling and embodiment practices to release limiting beliefs and clarify intentions.

### Description

Release the Past and Embody the Future:

This isn’t just an art workshop. It’s a creative and emotional reset designed to help you start the new year with clarity, courage, and alignment.

Over the course of 2½ powerful days, we use **intentional creativity** to examine what’s been weighing us down—and to free what’s ready to rise.

How Alchemy Happens

We begin by turning inward. Through guided journaling and inquiry, you’ll name the limiting beliefs, traps, habits, and internalized pressure that have quietly shaped your past year. The things you’ve tolerated. The weight you’ve carried.

Then, you’ll paint your way into that truth. **You’ll create a full-body expression of the year you’re ready to leave behind.** And then—**you’ll destroy it.** Not in anger, but in liberation. In devotion to your next becoming.

From that cleared space, something extraordinary happens.

You begin to dream again.

We’ll then invite your unconscious desires forward—the hopes, longings, and vision that may have been buried beneath duty, fear, or survival. From this intuitive clarity, you’ll paint again—not what you *should* want, but what your soul is truly calling in.

This second painting becomes your **embodied vision board**—not a collage of pretty pictures and goals, but a powerful, energetic map of your internal and external desires. One that your nervous system can recognize and move toward. One your whole being can stand behind.

You’re here to remember what you truly want—and to make space for it, from the inside out.

Back by popular demand, 8th year running, annual event. Five star reviews.

## Metalsmithing 101: The Basics Intensive Jan 10th and 11th

**Date:** Sunday, January 11, 2026 at 9:00 AM

**Location:** Ignite Jewelry Studios, 84 W Walnut St Unit A, Asheville, NC

**Organizer:** Ignite Jewelry Studios

**Price:** $499

**Source:** AVL_TODAY

**Tags:** Crafts, Education, metalsmithing, jewelry-making, beginner-friendly, hands-on, weekend-intensive

**Score:** 17/30 (Rarity: 6, Unique: 6, Magnitude: 5)
**Score Reason:** A 2-day, 16-hour weekend intensive — a limited, missable workshop run (special limited-run) with a focused, high-concept hands-on craft experience; professional local studio offering with a small-class, hyper-local draw.

**AI Summary:** Offering hands-on weekend intensive training in basic metalsmithing techniques including soldering and bezel setting.

### Description

Want to learn to make jewelry? This beginner friendly introductory metalsmithing course teaches the basics skills involved in making your own jewelry. Learn to use a variety of tools and equipment common in a jewelry studio.

This Intensive 16 hour 2 day workshop will teach many techniques including sawing, filing, polishing, soldering, bezel setting, textures, and more! $499 plus a $55 materials fee (paid separate at class)

Class Times: Saturday Jan 10th 9-5 and Sunday Jan 11th 9-5

Students will also have access to 4 Open Studio sessions to practice their skills (valid for 3 months from last day of class.) A knowledgable instructor is present during these sessions for questions and safety. Current Open Studio time: Wednesdays 10-4pm

Please know this will be a substantial amount of information over the two days and the intensity may not be ideal for everyone. Some jewelry making knowledge may be beneficial, but is not required. The course is designed to teach the skills through a series of jewelry pieces.

It is designed to teach techniques and skills rather than completing actual aesthetically pleasing pieces, but the goal is that everyone can complete 2-3 pieces of finished jewelry or more. Attending some or all Open Studios will absolutely ensure this and likely many more pieces!

\*This is the next Metalsmithing 101 offered as an intensive on a weekend format. See February for the next 4-Part Series

Slow down and be with yourself through art making. A rich morning that feeds your spirit, rests your body, quiets your mind and helps you remember who you are!

Here we will use the arts to have a conversation with ourselves and connect to our longings and gifts. This is not about religion, yet in the inquiry you may choose to make connections to your religious beliefs.

The format: We check in as a group, we may do a little drumming, have 5 minutes of quiet/reflection/meditation/prayer/relaxation time, go create art in silence (without talking) doing our own thing and then come back together to honor what we spent our time doing.

Art making can be painting, writing, sand tray, collage, doodling, scribbling, sewing, mixed media, movement, or…. No previous art experience necessary just the willingness to follow what you are attracted to and moving slow and quiet.

Tickets are $15 per person and admission goes directly to the care of our resident panthers.

Children ages 12 and up are able to attend but it is meant to be calm and relaxing for all attendees so please keep that in mind. (We love kids but sometimes our stressors are our kids and we need time to ourselves!)

A Connection Practice is a meeting to practice your skills in listening and connecting with others. No conversation topic is off limits. The only objective of the meeting is to feel a genuine sense of connection by the time it's over, and the only rule is that we promise to not give each other advice.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates.

### Description

As we cross the threshold into a New Year, we invite you to gather with us in a safe, confidential, and supportive space to share, reflect, and connect with community. This is a time to gently tend to what the holidays and seasonal shifts are stirring within, and to arrive just as you are.

Integration is a practice of intentionally slowing down, listening inward, and making meaning of our experiences so they can truly support and enrich our lives. Through integration, we can cultivate greater awareness of our thoughts, emotions, and patterns, allowing us to move through life’s changes with greater resilience, clarity, and compassion.

We are delighted to welcome Becca Marshall as our new Integration Circle facilitator. Becca is an Integrative Psychotherapist, Aligned Living Coach, Psychedelic Integration Guide, and the founder of ActivXchange. Her work supports individuals navigating major life transitions, whether entering adulthood, stepping into leadership, or guiding others through healing and transformation, with grounded presence and deep care.

Alongside Becca, there will also be psychedelic practitioners and seasoned explorers who will be available to answer questions, share wisdom, and support you as you make meaning out of your journey.

This ongoing circle is open to all whether you are simply curious, actively preparing for or integrating psychedelic experiences, or have been walking this path for some time. Our intention is to foster connection, shared wisdom, and mutual support within our ever-growing psychedelic community here in Asheville. All are welcome. Please note that this is a sober event and we do not allow attendees to use our gatherings to sell, buy, or source anything illegal. Those violating these rules will be kindly asked to leave.

**Score:** 11/30 (Rarity: 3, Unique: 5, Magnitude: 3)
**Score Reason:** A local, beginner-friendly breathwork session at a small studio—not a one-off destination act (many similar events at this venue), so moderately missable. Offers solid high-concept wellness/ceremonial energy but is a small, hyper-local draw rather than a regional headliner.

**AI Summary:** Guiding an intentional breathwork journey into expanded consciousness for deep somatic healing and personal empowerment.

### Description

🌬️ **Breathe beyond the mind and into the wisdom of your soul.** 🌬️
Join us for a powerful **Soul Journey Breathwork** experience—a sacred space where breath becomes the bridge to clarity, healing, and deep transformation. This is not just a breathing technique—it is a journey into expanded consciousness, personal empowerment, and profound self-discovery.

**What to Expect**

Together, we will begin by setting **intentions** and establishing an **energetic container** to hold our experience. You will then be guided through a 60-minute breathwork journey, followed by a period of **gentle integration**, reflection, and grounding.

Unlike traditional breath practices designed for relaxation, this active breathwork shifts brain chemistry, silences mental noise, and allows you to access heightened states of awareness. Through rhythmic breath and an immersive soundscape, you’ll open the door to deep healing, emotional release, and soul-aligned insights.

During the experience, Marian will intuitively place crystals on and around each participant, creating a supportive energetic field to deepen your process. The stones work in harmony with the breath, amplifying release, grounding, and spiritual connection.

Come ready to breathe, release, and realign, surrounded by the crystalline energy chosen just for you.

**This Breathwork Experience Will Help You:**
✨ Step into a sacred ceremonial space for inner exploration
✨ Receive guidance, healing, and support from both seen and unseen realms
✨ Expand your relationship with yourself as **healer, healed, and whole**
✨ Align with the frequency of your **deepest YES**
✨ Clear out anything keeping you from feeling **free, wild, limitless, expansive, & true**
✨ Reconnect with the **infinite inner wellspring of wisdom**

You can pay via cash, card, check, or Venmo when you arrive.

You will be provided with your sanitized supplies, or feel free to bring your own colored pencils, markers, or other art supplies to express yourself during this Connection Practice Meeting.

A Connection Practice is a meeting to practice your skills in listening and connecting with others. No conversation topic is off limits. The only objective of the meeting is to feel a genuine sense of connection by the time it's over, and the only rule is that we promise to not give each other advice.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates. All connection practices are free of charge.

### Description

Shut Up & Write!

**Here's how it works.** Show up at or before 6:00. At 6:00, we do some quick introductions. Afterward, for a full 60 minutes (I'll set a timer!) we are heads-down writing. Writing what? A novel? You bet. Some poetry? Sure. Song lyrics? Your resume? That report you need to get to your boss before 8 AM or you'll *need* *to write* that resume? All of the above and more. Just shut up and write.

Surrounding ourselves with other writers who are busy putting words onto page (physical or virtual) keeps us all accountable and focused.

When the timer goes off, we'll check-in with each other and see how it went. Afterward, feel free to stay to chat and get to know your fellow writers, or keep writing, or take off.

Socializing is optional and will happen after (or briefly before) the focused writing. This is a safe space to work on your craft. No one will read or critique your writing.

For more information about our events, visit [https://shutupwrite.com](https://shutupwrite.com).

**What to Expect**

* Roughly 15 minutes of introductions
* 60 minutes of focused writing (somebody set a timer)!
* Afterward, optional socializing

**Being late is okay:** Just show up and get settled, then check in with the host after the session. (Look for the person with the Shut Up & Write sign).

**What Should I Bring?**

* Whatever you need to be able to write!
* Earbuds/earplugs if you want to block ambient noise.

**Other Important Details:**

HOSTS: This is a multi-host event, so most of the time there will be a host present. If we are unlucky and no host can attend, please find each other and self-organize. Pay attention to the event chat and comments to see who is available.

WI-FI: Yes!

PARKING: Street parking in metered spots is free after 6pm. Closest municipal garages ($2/hour) are Wall St. & Coxe Street/Sears Alley.

**Score:** 12/30 (Rarity: 5, Unique: 5, Magnitude: 2)
**Score Reason:** A one-night book discussion of a Nobel-winning novel at a local pizza spot — more special than a weekly meetup thanks to the title’s prestige, but a small, hyper-local draw and a fairly typical book-club format.

**AI Summary:** Exploring a gripping political narrative that confronts dictatorship, complicity, and personal trauma through multiple perspectives.

### Description

WINNER OF THE NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE

In The Feast of the Goat, this 'masterpiece of Latin American and world literature, and one of the finest political novels ever written' (Bookforum), Mario Vargas Llosa recounts the end of a regime and the birth of a terrible democracy, giving voice to the historical Trujillo and the victims, both innocent and complicit, drawn into his deadly orbit.

Haunted all her life by feelings of terror and emptiness, forty-nine-year-old Urania Cabral returns to her native Dominican Republic - and finds herself reliving the events of l961, when the capital was still called Trujillo City and one old man terrorized a nation of three million. Rafael Trujillo, the depraved ailing dictator whom Dominicans call the Goat, controls his inner circle with a combination of violence and blackmail. In Trujillo's gaudy palace, treachery and cowardice have become a way of life. But Trujillo's grasp is slipping. There is a conspiracy against him, and a Machiavellian revolution already underway that will have bloody consequences of its ow

**Score:** 13/30 (Rarity: 3, Unique: 7, Magnitude: 3)

**AI Summary:** Combining vocal activation exercises to access light language with hands-on sound and energy healing.

### Description

During our time we will explore vocal exercises and sounds to activate your light language. The vocal exercises are great for clearing and moving energy throughout your body, while easing your nervous system. This creates space to allow more energetic flow through your whole being.

Following this interactive session, you then will lay down and receive sound and energy healing to integrate your process. We all have the ability to access light language and if you have been called or intrigued, please reach out!

This is a non-judgement, safe container for free expression and play.

When: Tuesday, January 13th
Time: 6:30pm-8pm
Sliding Scale: $25-40

**Lauren’s Bio:**

As a certified Reiki Master, Advanced IET Practitioner, and Munay‑Ki Shamanic Practitioner, I blend deep knowledge of energetic systems with intuitive guidance.

My journey into healing led me to train in sound healing, vocal therapy, Ayurveda, and natural medicines—all central to my transformative approach. For nearly a decade, I’ve been channeling light language, a vibrational transmission that transcends words to spark profound energetic shifts.

I hold private sessions and lead group gatherings, always cultivating a safe, nurturing environment where deep healing and self‑discovery can unfold. I believe true healing occurs when we reconnect with our essence, release what no longer serves us, and step into our highest potential.

My work supports this process—facilitating energetic realignment, spiritual awakening, and personal growth. My mission is to hold space for transformation, empowering each person to reclaim their inner light and walk a path of wholeness.

Sanders, Boyd, Page & Hall distill the pure essence of improvisational expression, converging as alchemists of sound, transmuting musical elements into their most essential forms. This quartet embodies the philosophical concept of quintessence—the fifth element beyond earth, air, fire, and water—representing the fundamental substance from which all musical reality springs. Their original compositions crystallize the essential qualities of diverse influences, oscillating between through-composed musical themes, groove-based soul explorations, traditional jazz-influenced pieces, Americana-inspired peaceful melodicism, world music influences, free jazz adventures, and occasional forays into cacophonous noise music. Through years of improvisational study, they've learned to access that rarefied space where genres dissolve into pure creative energy. In this musical laboratory, Sanders' guitar becomes a conduit for universal vibration, Boyd's reeds channel the breath of consciousness itself, Page's bass provides the fundamental frequency of existence, while Hall's percussion creates the rhythmic heartbeat of the cosmos. Will Boyd - Sax, Flute, Clarinet, EWI Zack Page - Acoustic & Electric Bass Alan Hall - Drums Jay Sanders - Guitar and Effects Every Monday and Tuesday, Little Jumbo brings live jazz to your ears. littlejumbobar.com “Simply put, Little Jumbo should be at the top of your list of places for cocktails in Asheville.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates.

We believe Black people deserve a space to relax, reassess, and realign ourselves.

We are a collective of Black stress-management & wellness instructors inspired by human values.

We are here to facilitate your journey of trauma-relief and stress-management.

Imagine how much more energy you will have and how much more powerful you will be when you cut your stress levels in half!

And it can be done in just a few minutes using nothing but your own breath...

Over the last 10 years, we've taught over 100,000 people to do just that.
The key is that your breath is directly linked to your emotions.

This 1-Hour Restorative Session Includes:
-Open, safe space for sharing and self-care for Black people

**AI Summary:** Blending guided meditation and journaling to help artists listen inward and uncover emergent creative material.

### Description

* **We’ll explore the use of journaling and meditation in creative work. We’ll nurture the song within and see what that shy inner voice wants to tell us. It is about listening first – sensing what wants to become. This is a forum where artists can drop beneath the busy surface mind and listen for what's trying to emerge.**

**There are moments in our lives, there are moments in a day, when we seem to see beyond the usual--become clairvoyant. We reach then into reality. Such are the moments of our greatest happiness. Such are the moments of our greatest vision....At such times there is a song going on within us, a song to which we listen. It fills us with surprise. We marvel at it. We would continue to hear it. But few are capable of holding themselves in the state of listening to their song. Intellectuality steps in and as the song within us is of the utmost sensitiveness, it retires in the presence of the cold, material intellect. It is aristocratic and will not associate itself with the commonplace--and we fall back and become our ordinary selves. Yet we live in the memory of these songs which in moments of intellectual inadvertence have been possible to us. They are the pinnacles of our experience and it is the desire to express these intimate sensations, this song from within, which motivates the masters of all art.**

Saturn approaches Neptune in Aries,softening old defenses and dissolving identities that no longer fit the soul’s becoming. It is a time when ego structures thin like veils,revealing the deeper courage your soul has been cultivating through lifetimes. In Aries, this conjunction asks: *What new trail is your soul ready to walk—and what illusions must fall away for you to take the first step?*

Pluto’s continuing activation of Aquarius pushes us further into collective evolution—liberating, destabilizing, awakening. It is the storm and the spark,the breakdown of outdated systems and the birth of unimagined pathways of connection.

Uranus shifting toward Gemini opens neural and spiritual pathways,rewiring how we think, speak, and perceive truth, It is the messenger of the future, whispering through intuition, dream, and synchronicity.

In this workshop, we will explore these transits not as outer-world events, but as soul-initiations: invitations to release karmic imprints, awaken latent gifts, and step into a more authentic expression of purpose.

Come feel the mythic rhythm of these years—the unraveling, the ignition, the rising. Discover how your chart becomes a compass guiding you through the great evolutionary gateways of 2025–2026.
A journey for the brave, the curious, and all those...

**Score:** 20/30 (Rarity: 7, Unique: 7, Magnitude: 6)

**AI Summary:** Showcasing intimate, curated performances by emerging indie artists in a cozy tavern setting.

### Description

A highly curated live music show with artists you may not have heard of yet, but who are significantly making waves. Trust us.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates.

### Description

Join us for a relaxing sound bath meditation led by David Heiss, Master gong player and sound healing musician. David has been playing gongs and facilitating sound healing journeys since 2012. You can learn more about his work at [​https://starsounds.love](https://www.starsounds.love/)

Leave the week's stress behind as you relax and reset your nervous system with this special clearing crystal gong bath.

We will begin with a brief overview of the current astrology aspects in our sky. Then enjoy a powerful yet relaxing 45 min. gong meditation followed by an integration.

When the gong sings, you listen. You listen listens with every cell of your body. You hear it and feel it. You begin to sense more. The obscure sounds leave your brain guessing and eventually surrenders to the soundwave as you begin to relax, feel and heal. The vibrational frequencies can awaken stagnant energy. The experience is like a personal dream. There are moments during a gong meditation where the subconscious can become more conscious, where illumination and insight follows.

Suggested donations for this event are $20-40. Donations can be made at the event via cash or Venmo.

Please bring any comfort items you may desire: blankets, pillows, bolsters, eye mask, etc. We do not yet have enough community items for everyone.

* The event is from 6 - 7:30 p.m.

Please note- If you want to attend this event you need to purchase a ticket- We advertise in many places and only paid tickets will reserve your space.[ ](https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/jan-17th-an-evening-of-sensual-snuggles)**[CLICK HERE TO PURCHASE YOU TICKET AND RESERVE YOUR SPACE FOR THIS EVENT.](https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/jan-17th-an-evening-of-sensual-snuggles)**[ ](https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/jan-17th-an-evening-of-sensual-snuggles)

**What is a Sensual Snuggle Event?**
This is a sweet & welcoming event where we practice and use verbal consent to connect and share touch. We talk about boundaries and practice both saying and receiving a “no”. In this space it is common to see people cuddle, share massage, have their hair brushed, kiss, expose nipples, play, laugh, cry, and be vulnerable. This is a sober space where we can relax and connect with other humans who are seeking touch based connection.
We strive for this to be a safe event. Safe touch enhances our ability to connect with and trust people. When we are in a space of safety, we are able to relax, feel comfort, and be vulnerable.

**Our Agreements:**
1- We ask for what we want an wait for a yes before touching others.
2- We say no if we don’t want to do something.
3- We try to receive a no with grace and not take it personally.
4- We arrive on time, clean (as scent free as possible), and sober.
5- We keep our pants/shorts on at this event. (Tops are optional; this is a sensual space, not a sexual space.)
6- We are here to connect with others. Connection can be verbal, platonic, or spicy!
7- We welcome diversity. Isms and Phobias are not welcome here!

**Who should attend:**
People who are interested in safely exploring touch and sensuality with strangers. This includes people who are single, people who are not single, couples, folks who are new to town and looking for connection, people of all/any genders and sexual orientations, people of all ages (18 and up).

**AI Summary:** Exploring meditative journaling to access the inner creative voice and generate song-focused prompts.

### Description

* **We’ll explore the use of journaling and meditation in creative work. We’ll nurture the song within and see what that shy inner voice wants to tell us. It is about listening first – sensing what wants to become. This is a forum where artists can drop beneath the busy surface mind and listen for what's trying to emerge.**

**There are moments in our lives, there are moments in a day, when we seem to see beyond the usual--become clairvoyant. We reach then into reality. Such are the moments of our greatest happiness. Such are the moments of our greatest vision....At such times there is a song going on within us, a song to which we listen. It fills us with surprise. We marvel at it. We would continue to hear it. But few are capable of holding themselves in the state of listening to their song. Intellectuality steps in and as the song within us is of the utmost sensitiveness, it retires in the presence of the cold, material intellect. It is aristocratic and will not associate itself with the commonplace--and we fall back and become our ordinary selves. Yet we live in the memory of these songs which in moments of intellectual inadvertence have been possible to us. They are the pinnacles of our experience and it is the desire to express these intimate sensations, this song from within, which motivates the masters of all art.**

https://youtu.be/vw00F6jof9Q?si=r6KXcnCocb3m7JGD

Founded in 2005, Pisgah is known for producing some of the most sought after craft ales in Western North Carolina. Pisgah Brewing Company currently operates the new indoor taproom & deli, with live music several days a week, plus an open air outdoor bar in the summer and fall months.

Bar: 4PM | Deli: 4PM | Music: 7PM Carolina Bluegrass Style is a unique blend of young and old, past, present, and perhaps the future of bluegrass music. When Tommy Thomas asked Tyler Chasteen, Don Ashley, and David Prosser to get together and play some music, they had no idea they would be creating a new group. Yet, the popularity of the group has surpassed all expectations. While all the members of the band live in the Columbia, SC area, they have been honing their sound in restaurants, clubs, and other venues around Asheville, NC. Founded in 2005, Pisgah is known for producing some of the most sought after craft ales in Western North Carolina. Pisgah Brewing Company currently operates the new indoor taproom & deli, with live music several days a week, plus an open air outdoor bar in the summer and fall months.

### Description

ALL AGESPARTIALLY SEATED SHOW (guaranteed seating AND standing room only tickets are available at checkout) CHATHAM COUNTY LINE Launched a little more than twenty years ago in Raleigh, North Carolina, Chatham County Line built a devoted local following on the strength of their genre-bending live show-an intoxicating blend of bluegrass, folk, country, and rock and roll-before breaking out internationally with their 2003 self-titled debut.

NPR hailed the group as "a bridge between bluegrass traditions and a fresh interpretation of those influences," while Uncut lauded their "powerful melodies and gorgeous harmonies," and Pitchfork dubbed their music "timeless."

## Sensory Immersion Night  with Senseful Wellness

**Tags:** Wellness, Education, sensory-immersion, nervous-system-regulation, somatic-experience, trauma-informed, group-workshop

**Score:** 12/30 (Rarity: 3, Unique: 6, Magnitude: 3)
**Score Reason:** A recurring, free small-group wellness/workshop at a local studio — niche and appealing (somatic/sensory focus) so moderately unique, but low urgency and a hyper-local, small-scale draw.

**AI Summary:** Exploring guided sensory practices to recalibrate the nervous system and reconnect mind and body after stress or trauma.

### Description

**Sensory Immersion Night**
Have you explored sensory Exploration for your nervous system?
Our senses have a beautiful way of grounding us into the present moment but this can take some work. Our sensory world can also become disconnected when our nervous system has stayed in pattern loops from high levels of stress and/or trauma.

This is essentially a disconnect of mind and body. The sensory information we receive from the outside world, drives movement patterns in the body. So, if we’re constantly perceiving the world as unsafe, we will move in that way.

**How do we begin to correct this?**
We start the practice of reintegrating the senses. Meditating can be challenging when we’ve been in a heightened state, so exploring adding additional sensory input can help to get you out of attachment to your busy racing thoughts and into the feelings/sensations created in your body. The more you explore the five traditional senses more mindfully, the more you can perceive energy. The more energy you perceive, the more you feel connected to everything. Learning to express and move energy is vulnerable, but as the research shows, vulnerability is the key to personal freedom.

This evening will be all about tuning in and listening to your needs. This is a neurodivergent friendly space that honors consent and personal preferences.

**What to expect:**
mindful sensory exploration
stations to explore various sensory techniques
group meditation with added sensory input
Donation only/pay what you can

**Score:** 23/30 (Rarity: 8, Unique: 8, Magnitude: 7)
**Score Reason:** Cult anti-comedy character (Neil Hamburger) is a one-night touring stop at mid-size Grey Eagle — highly missable one-off, very unusual/quirky performance style, solid regional draw at a major local venue.

**AI Summary:** Showcasing anti-comedy character work with awkward deadpan delivery and bewildering, intentionally uncomfortable punchlines.

### Description

ALL AGES FULLY SEATED SHOW LIMITED NUMBER OF PREMIUM SEATING TICKETS AVAILABLE NEIL HAMBURGER America's Funnyman Neil Hamburger is the hardest working comedian in existence, performing up to 399 shows a year internationally to critical acclaim and audience bewilderment. He has toured as the hand-picked opener for Tenacious D, Tim & Eric, and Faith No More, appeared on TV shows ranging from Tim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job! to Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and worked extensively with Tom Green on his internet talk show. Among his dozen or so albums and DVDs is the new LP release Neil Hamburger Present: Seasonal Depression Suite. "A phlegm-filled sack of putrid self-loathing, Neil Hamburger is the perfect satire of a slick, professional nightclub comedian. If you've ever suspected that behind the glossy veneer of fake bonhomie of those perma-smile acts lies an ugly, embittered, grotesque soul - well Hamburger is that demon made flesh. In some living Sisyphean hell, every night he dons his tuxedo, greases down his hair and ploughs through the vile set that disgusts even him, just so he can earn a three-piece chicken dinner. His contempt for his own pitiful existence is surpassed only for his contempt for the audience who compel him trudge through his despicable cavalcade of jokes. And my, these gags are certainly not for the faint of heart, as he plumbs the depths of depravity for the sake of a laugh." - Chortle (UK) "Hamburger is the clapped-out husk of a decorous Southern gentleman, now coughing in painful hacks, suppurating filth through his tuxedo, and her to tip a slurry of abuse all over celebrity and modern life.a combination of malignance and desiccated vaudeville." - The Guardian (UK) "Neil Hamburger remains the greatest comedian I've seen the greater majority of an audience walk out on.... No one was leaving their seats this evening though, as this peerless performer shocked and delighted in equal measure.... On the road for 12 years with scarcely a day off, Hamburg...

**Score:** 22/30 (Rarity: 8, Unique: 7, Magnitude: 7)
**Score Reason:** A one-night stop by a reputable touring company makes this fairly missable (True one-off feel) but not unique to the level of a festival; a fresh, music-driven Shakespeare with a preshow talk gives strong ‘main character’ energy; professional national tour at the Wortham Center yields a solid regional draw.

**AI Summary:** Featuring family-focused, multi-distance road races from a 100-yard kids dash to a competitive half-marathon.

### Description

The Asheville Hot Chocolate races has been the highlight of Western North Carolina’s winter running season since 2008. The race began as a simple 10k with a 1k kids hill climb.

### Description

Dorlop Rinpoché, Dr. Lye will offer a weekend retreat at Urban Dharma in Asheville, North Carolina on the weekend of January 24 & 25 focused on Boundless Light Buddha (Amitabha) and his Realm of Bliss (Dewachen). This program will include a Boundless Light Buddha empowerment from "The Profound Intent of the Secret Essence Cycle of Dharmas" upheld in the Drikung Kagyu Lineage. 

Dr. Lye is offering this program to serve as a support for the Phowa Transmission that he offered a few months ago. Furthermore, Dr. Lye intends to offer a special focus on practices of the Lotus Family of the Secret Mantra (Vajrayana) in this coming year of 2026. 

So stay tuned for the announcement of a few more weekend programs on various deities and practices of this buddha-family. Those who are the desirous, possessive, controlling, creative, and discerning types have an affinity with the Lotus Family and its practices can help us clear the causes of suffering and achieve the causes of happiness in the most efficient and swift manner.

[NOTE: As this is a Vajrayana empowerment, please only attend if you understand that the Vajrayana path is based on training in pure perception. At the very least, initiates need to be ready to train in pure perception of the Vejrayana methods, of the teacher giving the empowerment and, of fellow initiates.]

This is a Zoom and in-person program.

**Tags:** Outdoors, Tours, Education, Community

**Score:** 13/30 (Rarity: 3, Unique: 6, Magnitude: 4)

**AI Summary:** Guided telescopic Moon observing with crater-focused explanations and hands-on viewing.

**Score:** 23/30 (Rarity: 8, Unique: 8, Magnitude: 7)
**Score Reason:** Sudan Archives is a national touring, one-night stop at The Orange Peel—so fairly missable locally but not repeatable (rarity 8). The violin-led, genre-bending, looped R&B with West African rhythms is highly distinctive (unique 8). Playing the Orange Peel gives it strong regional/national draw without being stadium-level (magnitude 7).

**Score:** 20/30 (Rarity: 7, Unique: 7, Magnitude: 6)
**Score Reason:** One-night touring jam-band stop at a small Brevard venue — more special than a weekly gig but not a huge national headliner. Genre-fluid, high-energy jams give it strong ’main character’ appeal for the regional jam scene, though the scale and venue keep it mid-level draw.

**AI Summary:** Delivering genre-fluid rock with extended improvisational jams and high-energy, crowd-driven festival vibes.

### Description

### Description

ALL AGES SEATED SHOW LIMITED NUMBER OF PREMIUM SEATING TICKETS AVAILABLE WILLIS ALAN RAMSEY Over 50 years after the release of his wildly influential self-titled album on Leon Russell's Shelter Records, Willis Alan Ramsey returns to touring. Ramsey's debut in 1972 earned scores of accolades from arti-sts ranging from The Allman Brothers to Lyle Lovett. The album was mined by many artists for their o_wn recordings including Jimmy Buffett's "The Ballad of Spider John", Jimmie Dale Gilmore's "Goodbye Old Missoula", Shawn Colvin's "Satin Sheets", Captain & Tennille's "Muskrat Candlelight/Love", Jerry Jeff Walker's "Northeast Texas Women", Waylon Jennings' "Satin Sheets", New Grass Revival's "Watermelon Man", and many more. Since that landmark first release, Ramsey has toured only occasionally, spending time instead with his family, honing his craft in Austin, Nashville and London, educating himself in the science of audio recording and composing new songs. His new material has received critical acclaim, including Lyle Lovett's recordings of "Sleepwalkin"', "North Dakota" and "That's Right (You're Not From Texas"), as well as Eric Clapton's recording of"Positively". Ramsey's infrequent personal appearances always gamer excitement among some of the top critics in the country as well as from his fellow artists: "His cozy, orderly, tiny-detail songs express a willful turnabout from hippie chaos, a visceral reaction particular to the early 1970's. His songs are sweet, emotionally guarded and often musically complex, fitting strains of melody together that seem as if they ought not connect, expertly using rhythmic displacement as the words and chords unspool .... Perfection is terrifying, and some of these songs felt spooky." - Ben Ratliff, The New York Times "You might have not seen him lately, but if you've listened to Shawn, Lyle or Jimmie Dale, you've heard him." - John T. Davis, The Austin American Statesman "Even if Ramsey had made a dozen more albums, this would still ...

### Description

For our next book club, we will be discussing Cahokia Jazz by Francis Spufford. I wasn't at the previous meeting to help with the selection of this book, but hopefully it works for people. It's longer than what we typically select too, but we do have over a month to read it, so we'll see how it goes!

**As we discussed recently, Meetup is charging the fee for running the group again. If you haven't contributed in a while, or feel like you could or want to contribute more, I appreciate any help and whatever you are comfortable with doing! Thank you so much for your help and for continuing to show and up and support the group. I look forward to seeing you at the next meeting. You're welcome to bring cash in person or send to my Venmo whenever! It's Tobias-Roth-2**

The description for the book reads:

A thrilling tale of murder and mystery in a city where history has run a little differently—from the bestselling author of *Golden Hill*.

In a city that never was, in an America that never was, on a snowy night at the end of winter, two detectives find a body on the roof of a skyscraper.

It's 1922, and Americans are drinking in speakeasies, dancing to jazz, stepping quickly to the tempo of modern times. Beside the Mississippi, the ancient city of Cahokia lives on—a teeming industrial metropolis, containing every race and creed. Among them, peace holds. Just about. But that body on the roof is about to spark off a week that will spill the city's secrets, and bring it, against a soundtrack of wailing clarinets and gunfire, either to destruction or rebirth.

The multiple-award-winning Francis Spufford returns, with a lovingly created, richly pleasure-giving, epically scaled tale set in the golden age of wicked entertainments.

Activate the light within is about holding space for you to rest your body and cultivate a deep sense of ease allowing your innate healing to take place.

Lauren will give the group reiki and combine sound with crystal singing bowls, koshi chimes and drum. Light language will also be incorporated throughout the journey.

These three healing modalities weave beautifully together creating a powerful activation within the body, mind and soul.

Description of energy healing: Healing techniques that gently clear stored traumas, stagnation, emotional blocks within the body and tissues. Energy healing restores the body, mind, and spirit back to natural balance and overall wellbeing.

Time: 6:30pm-7:30pm

As a certified Reiki Master, Advanced IET Practitioner, and Munay‑Ki Shamanic Practitioner, I blend deep knowledge of energetic systems with intuitive guidance.

My journey into healing led me to train in sound healing, vocal therapy, Ayurveda, and natural medicines—all central to my transformative approach. For nearly a decade, I’ve been channeling light language, a vibrational transmission that transcends words to spark profound energetic shifts.

I hold private sessions and lead group gatherings, always cultivating a safe, nurturing environment where deep healing and self‑discovery can unfold. I believe true healing occurs when we reconnect with our essence, release what no longer serves us, and step into ...

Their original compositions crystallize the essential qualities of diverse influences, oscillating between through-composed musical themes, groove-based soul explorations, traditional jazz-influenced pieces, Americana-inspired peaceful melodicism, world music influences, free jazz adventures, and occasional forays into cacophonous noise music. Through years of improvisational study, they've learned to access that rarefied space where genres dissolve into pure creative energy. In this musical laboratory, Sanders' guitar becomes a conduit for universal vibration, Boyd's reeds channel the breath of consciousness itself, Page's bass provides the fundamental frequency of existence, while Hall's percussion creates the rhythmic heartbeat of the cosmos.

ALL AGES SEATED SHOW LIMITED NUMBER OF PREMIUM SEATING TICKETS AVAILABLE THE CODY SISTERS The Cody Sisters band is the very heart of contemporary acoustic Folk and Bluegrass music in Colorado, the United States and the UK. Their propulsive instrumental solos and warm harmonies combine to grip the listener. Along with their bass player Will Pavilonis, sisters Megan (guitar, mandolin, vocals) and Maddie (guitar, banjo, vocals) have forged a new sound that has no equivalent match in the acoustic world today. In May of 2023, The Cody Sisters released their self-titled EP marking a new beginning for the band. It is their first release since parting ways with their former image of "young girls in a family band" and it portrays a sense of maturity and musical understanding that reveals a new dimension to their artistic expression. They set out to explore new sounds and styles while still holding true to their bluegrass roots, and they have done just that. This new music is an invitation to connect, to feel, and to journey together through original lyrics and captivating instrumental arrangements. The Cody Sisters have a sound that is original, exhilarating, and heartwarming all at the same time. With strong ties to traditional American acoustic music, they continue to stun their audiences both in the US and abroad.
