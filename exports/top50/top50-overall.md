**Score Reasoning:** A one-off touring stop by ALT ASO — a genre-bending, mobile chamber orchestra with crossover (opera to metal) appeal and VIP presales. Felt like a special limited-date event (highly missable) performed at a campus arts center; the unmistakably 'Asheville-weird' crossover boost pushes uniqueness to the top while its regional touring draw gives it solid magnitude.

| Asheville Weird      | 6/10      |
| Social / Meet People | 7/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** A one-night 15th anniversary tasting led by Cúrate co-founders is a rare, can't-miss celebration with high culinary cachet — very ‘Asheville’ in its Appalachian + Spanish fusion. It’s a high-concept, chef-driven dinner likely to attract foodies and locals alike (limited seating, community vibe), but it’s not an arena-scale or wildly experimental spectacle.

**AI Summary:** Spanish tapas and hospitality meet Appalachian ingredients in a special anniversary tasting dinner led by co-founders Félix Meana and Katie Button, celebrating Cúrate's 15-year legacy in downtown Asheville.

<details>
<summary>Full Description</summary>

Fifteen years ago, Cúrate opened its doors in downtown Asheville with a simple mission: to share the culture and hospitality of Spain while embracing Appalachian ingredients. What has followed has been shaped by this community through moments of comfort, resilience, and growth, and now... celebration!

On March 11th, co-founders @felixmeana and @chefkatiebutton invite you to join them for a special anniversary dinner marking this milestone and looking ahead to what comes next. For one night only, Felix and Katie will guide you through a celebratory prix fixe crafted by Executive Chef Ángel Palacios specifically for the occasion, offering a rare experience beyond our regular service.

We’ve gathered some dear industry friends who have helped shape our story over the years to join us in creating an unforgettable evening. An optional wine pairing, developed in collaboration with our friend Lucas Payà, former head sommelier at elBulli and the José Andrés group, will spotlight producers who have been foundational to our list. The jamoneros from Cinco Jotas will also join us, slicing their prized Jamón Ibérico throughout the evening.

Reservations are now available on resy with seatings from 5:00 pm through 8:30 pm. We hope you’ll join us to raise a glass to fifteen years of shared meals and friendships with our Asheville community, and to all the exciting events and developments still to come!

| Magnitude & Caliber  | 8/10      |
| Asheville Weird      | 4/10      |
| Social / Meet People | 4/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** Jay Electronica is a rare, cult-level touring headliner and this intimate one-off at Eulogy is easily missable (high urgency). Expect a high-concept, spiritually dense hip‑hop performance—very distinctive for fans—while the small-club setting gives strong national-caliber draw but limited social/networking potential and only a mildly ‘Asheville weird’ vibe.

**AI Summary:** Intimate hip hop headline set of dense, spiritual lyricism laid over orchestral and boom bap production; expect extended poetic verses, improvisation, and a contemplative late night vibe for devoted fans.

**Score Reasoning:** One-night touring improv dating show at The Orange Peel (major regional venue) — award-winning, high-energy and highly social with audience participation. Feels like a true one-off in town (rare), very entertaining/novel but not deeply 'Asheville weird.' Great for meeting singles.

**Score Reasoning:** A limited-stop touring contemporary circus at the Diana Wortham feels like a special, must-see theatrical run (rarity 7). High-concept, surreal circus/dance gives strong Main Character Energy and earns the Asheville-weird bonus (unique 10, ashevilleWeird 8). Mid-to-high regional draw for a professional touring ensemble at a notable local theater (magnitude 7). Seated theater performance offers little social mingling (social 2).

**AI Summary:** Breathtaking 75 minute blend of contemporary circus, dance, and physical theatre that follows a woman plunged into a surreal world where memories come to life and the ordinary becomes extraordinary.

**Score Reasoning:** One-night touring stop by iconic/quirky songwriter Jonathan Richman with Tommy Larkins at The Grey Eagle — a true limited-run club show (highly missable). High 'main character' energy and distinctive, conversational performance (plus an 'Asheville weird' boost). Grey Eagle is a strong regional draw but not arena scale.

**AI Summary:** Jonathan Richman leads an exuberant singer-songwriter set backed by Tommy Larkins' propulsive drumming, delivering sparse, beat-driven rock with conversational lyrics in an intimate, standing-room-only, all-ages club.

ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY LIVE! ON STAGE: JONATHAN RICHMAN featuring TOMMY LARKINS on the drums! "Richman is one of America's most unique and dynamic songwriters." - Nashville Scene "Richman didn't need much else besides a beat to work his magic." - New York Daily News "Buy tickets early. Buy tickets often. This is just good general life advice, but even more so when you're talking about Jonathan Richman. Don't get denied at the door, don't leave things up to chance: You will regret it." - Nashville Scene "Rhymes worthy of Ogden Nash." - The New York Times "Richman has spent decades removing barriers between himself and his audience, cultivating an intimacy that is almost extinct in modern music."- Nashville Scene "As of a few years ago, I was going to just play theaters, cabarets and such, but we ended up by mistake at the Zebulon in Los Angeles and had such a fine time that those kind of shows have to happen too. So, you might see us nowadays in theaters, cabaret-style places, or the right club or bar. The theaters have the best sound, usually, and under-21s can get in, but in the clubs people can dance and get close in to ya, like we like. We'll keep trying things."

**Score Reasoning:** Ivy Lab is an internationally respected drum & bass duo doing a true farewell tour stop — a fairly missable one-off in an intimate Third Room club setting. High in novelty and musical caliber for bass-heads (regional draw), it’s a lively, dance-focused show with moderate social potential and a bit of Asheville underground vibe.

**AI Summary:** Bass-heavy drum and bass and experimental bass sets by Gove Kidao and Jay Fogel as Ivy Lab conclude their decade-long collaboration on a farewell tour, premiering final tracks in Third Room's intimate club setting.

After more than 10 years, Ivy Lab is bringing their collaboration to a close. Gove Kidao and Jay Fogel will perform a run of final shows and release the last music from the project throughout 2026 before moving on to new musical ventures.

In a statement posted on social media today, the duo said:
“After more than 10 years spreading our wings through a wild and varied array of leftfield beats, we’ve decided to call time on our flagship project and look ahead to new adventures in sound. 2026 will be our last year of operation.”

Kidao and Fogel came together as Ivy Lab in 2013, having already carved out strong presences in drum & bass as Sabre and Stray respectively. On early releases they were also joined by Laurence Reading, aka Halogenix, and released music on Critical Recordings. The focus for Ivy Lab was a more freeform approach to bass weight music, moving beyond the boundaries of drum & bass to explore a wider range of tempos and intensities, not least half-time, hip-hop–informed beats. In 2015, Ivy Lab felt the need to create a space in which to move freely with this new direction, launching their label Twenty Twenty London with an expansive double-pack album that showcased the range they were manifesting in the studio.

Over time, Ivy Lab has grown to encompass a powerful, idiosyncratic strain of hybrid club music spread across a vast archive of EPs and albums, while Twenty Twenty London has become a prominent hub for emergent talent creating beats outside the dominant genre lines of modern electronic music.

Kidao and Fogel have sensed the right moment to call time on Ivy Lab, having achieved more than they could have imagined at the start of the project. Both artists will continue to release music individually as Stray and Sabre. Meanwhile, Twenty Twenty London will continue to nurture the community of artists orbiting the label and grow as an essential platform for new music.

Ending a creative endeavour at the right time can be just as important as starting one. Ivy Lab bow out with intention, savouring every last show and drawing a line under their fully realised vision for modernist bass weight that refused to be boxed in.

**Score Reasoning:** Tour stop for experimental bass acts at intimate Third Room — a true one-off night with high-concept, bass-heavy programming (Asheville-weird bonus applies). Small-club draw (regional touring artists) with decent dance/mingle potential and VIP booths, making it unique and timely but not a stadium-level event.

**AI Summary:** Bass-heavy experimental electronic sets push subsonic low end and skittering percussion through an intimate club setting, as pheel and Chez headline a tour stop with Tunic, BK, and Ephygy—VIP booths available.

pheel., aka Philip Gallo, hails from the east coast and is currently residing in Denver. Since he moved in 2016, he has immersed himself in developing a unique perspective on bass music, drawing influences from a mixture of his roots as well as the local Colorado community, pheel. strives to take his audience on a sonic adventure with each set, guiding them through equal parts hip-hop and “bass music”. He pays respect to the classics of his youth simultaneously reimagining these tracks with modern production techniques and rumbling bass lines.

Chez:

HEAR SOME MUSIC: **https://chez4prez.bandcamp.com**

SEE A VIDEO: **https://youtu.be/8dN4Px182L8?si=F-b-cIsc7xUhKBLh**

Hailing from Chicago, Chez is the electronic bass music producer who’s here to prove that cheese isn’t just for charcuterie boards—it’s a lifestyle. Pronounced like the dairy delight but spelled like a French bistro, Chez is 100% mice-friendly and 110% people-approved. Chez exists in a contemporary space of music built on the shoulders of stylistic icons from the past. He would likely say, “it’s just fun”, an ideal that is core to the energy of the noise. With ease, he rallies lifelong music experience that delightfully coexists with novel production. Full of references to the boom bap greats, Chez focuses on bass-forward electronic beats primed for the dance floor. As a result, the sound is oddly familiar while routinely asserting itself into the new. Simply put, the Chez project is about playfulness and connection. It’s music for the head-nodders, the dancers, and for anyone who believes in doing what you love with the people you love. Come for the beats, stay for the good times and cherish the connections made along the way.

**Score Reasoning:** National touring indie band (one-night stop) at The Grey Eagle — intimate, standing-room alt‑country/indie set with strong audience connection. Not a stadium act but a notable regional headliner.

**AI Summary:** Twangy, effervescent indie rock and alt country arrangements with confessional, emotive vocals and melodic guitar hooks from their sixth album. Expect high energy, standing room only sets in an intimate theater for intense audience connection.

<details>
<summary>Full Description</summary>

ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY RATBOYS Despite its title, Ratboys' new album "Singin' to an Empty Chair" is not defined by what's missing. Rather, it's the beginning of an important dialogue with a close loved one vocalist Julia Steiner finds herself estranged from. The music on the band's sixth studio album - its first for New West Records - fills the space that person left behind with 11 songs showcasing Ratboys at the peak of their powers - twangy, effervescent, as confident as they've ever been, and perhaps more emotionally interrogative than ever before. The four-piece Chicago band followed up 2023's highly acclaimed "The Window" by reconvening with co-producer Chris Walla to begin tracking at a rural Wisconsin cabin before taking the songs to Steve Albini's famed Electrical Audio studios in Chicago and later to Rosebud Studio in Evanston, Illinois. The results veer from bubbly power-pop on "Anywhere" to irresistible post-country on "Penny in the Lake," along with heart-piercing ballads like "Just Want You to Know the Truth" and an exhilarating detour into the extraterrestrial on "Light Night Mountains All That," which Steiner dubs the band's mammoth "wormhole jam." "Singin' to an Empty Chair" also marks the first Ratboys album written since Steiner began therapy, which the singer/lyricist credits for the clarity found across the album's unflinching examinations of relationship and self. Fittingly, as the album begins by extending a hand into the void, it concludes with a scene of serenity - all while weaving candid honesty, humor, chaos, and whimsy along the way. "It's not all doom and gloom," Steiner says. "The experience of making this record definitely gives me hope for whatever happens next." FLORRY For 'Sounds Like.' Florry's sophomore effort as a fully realized band, Francie Medosch and Co. decamped to Drop of Sun studios in the nest of the Blue Ridge Mountains to record with Asheville wunderkind Colin Miller, a critical voice behind the records of MJ Lenderman, Wednesday and Merce Lemon and a powerful songwriter in his own right. Three powerhouse days in late 2023 solidifi ed writing work done by the band earlier that summer in the now defunct Haw Creek compound under Miller's guiding suggestion. The result is a portrait of a ripping band cresting towards the height of their powers, uniquely equipped to capture a wildly loving, barn-burning camcorder clip of a turbulent trip with your best friends, without dipping into nostalgia bait. Lyrically, Medosch's utterances are both careful and excessive, the product of sifting through the rubble of classic good-time media, and fi nding what works for both her and her community to reach the heights of abandon."The Jackass theme song was actually a really big influence on the new album."

**Score Reasoning:** One-day/seasonal competitive tournament at Harrah's Cherokee Center — arena-level regional draw with high-energy stunts (entertaining and family-friendly) but a typical cheer event rather than a truly novel or once-in-a-decade spectacle.

**Score Reasoning:** Limited multi-night contemporary circus run at a prominent local performing-arts house (Wortham) — a high-concept, visually immersive aerial/physical-theater show with strong production value (regional draw). Not a daily event (limited run), creatively distinctive but not an explicitly quirky/underground Asheville-only tradition, and primarily a seated performance with low meet-new-people potential.

**AI Summary:** Kinetic contemporary circus blending aerial silks, tightwire feats, and gravity-defying partner acrobatics with theatrical choreography and live percussion, creating an immersive, visually striking exploration of seasonal transformation.

**Score Reasoning:** One-night, ticketed acoustic duet at The Grey Eagle featuring My Morning Jacket guitarist Carl Broemel and Asheville-based Tyler Ramsey — a high-quality, intimate regional draw with strong singer‑songwriter appeal; not especially weird and mostly a seated listening experience (limited socializing).

**AI Summary:** Interwoven acoustic folk-rock duet blending intimate singer-songwriter storytelling and intricate guitar textures from a My Morning Jacket guitarist; celebrates the new Celestun album in a fully seated, all-ages club show focused on harmonies.

<details>
<summary>Full Description</summary>

ALL AGES FULLY SEATED SHOW LIMITED NUMBER OF PREMIUM SEATING TICKETS AVAILABLE TYLER RAMSEY & CARL BROEMEL Having been friends and occasional touring partners for well over a decade, Asheville, NC-based singer-songwriter-guitarist Tyler Ramsey and My Morning Jacket guitarist Carl Broemel have at long last made their full-length recorded debut with Celestun out January 15. A marvel of interwoven musicianship and testament to the duo's singular camaraderie, the album encapsulates the two veteran guitarist-songwriters' mutual admiration and effortless compatibility as they swap and share nine new songs of dazzling dexterity and grace recorded almost entirely recorded on acoustic guitars. Though their initial objective had been all instrumental, the natural flow of the sessions led the duo to begin incorporating vocal tracks. Music at its most elemental, Celestun sees Carl Broemel and Tyler Ramsey stripping away artifice to unlock and explore deeply personal themes of wanderlust and familial love, of fellowship and communal adventure. "We don't step on each other's toes," says Carl Broemel, "we kind of fit together like puzzle pieces. Maybe that sounds grandiose, but that's how it feels to me when we're playing. We don't even have to talk about it." "We just mesh together in a way that I can't even really explain," says Tyler Ramsey. "I feel like there's some magical connection between our two things, it just makes me smile and satisfies some itch as far as things that I would like to hear on the music that I write. I think he feels the same way about what I do. When I put a part to one of his songs, we both have this feeling like that what exactly what was missing." Previously, Louisville, KY's Carl Broemel has released a series of solo recordings over the past two decades, including 2019's Brokenhearted Jubilee EP in collaboration with drummer Eric Hopper, and recent collaborations with The Futurebirds. Meanwhile, Tyler Ramsey, has earned praise for his former role as songwriter and lead guitarist in Band of Horses as well as an evolving solo body of work that includes 2024's acclaimed New Lost Ages, hailed by Americana UK as "a gentle indie-folk gem."

**Score Reasoning:** One-night touring stop with a distinctive lineup (vibraphone-led experimental punk-jazz + Ween’s drummer) — pretty missable if you sleep on it but not blockbuster. Very high on novelty and Asheville-style weirdness, mid-level regional draw at Third Room, and a small-club show with decent chances to mingle.

**Date:** Thursday, March 5, 2026 at 8:00 PM
**Location:** The Orange Peel, 101 Biltmore Ave, Asheville, NC (28801)
**Organizer:** The Orange Peel
**Price:** $39.09

### Scores

| Dimension            | Score     |
| -------------------- | --------- |
| **Total**            | **22/30** |
| Rarity & Urgency     | 8/10      |
| Cool & Unique        | 7/10      |
| Magnitude & Caliber  | 7/10      |
| Asheville Weird      | 5/10      |
| Social / Meet People | 6/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** One-night touring jamtronica/bass bill at The Orange Peel (limited run, fairly missable if you skip it). High-energy, dancefloor-focused sets give it solid ‘main character’ vibes and regional draw, but it’s a mainstream touring electronic show rather than an unusually quirky Asheville event — good for meeting people while dancing.

**AI Summary:** Bass-heavy live electronic sets with funk-infused grooves, glitchy synths, and improvisational jam passages that push a high-energy dancefloor vibe; support from genre-bending producer Phyphr and 18 plus admission.

| Asheville Weird      | -/10      |
| Social / Meet People | -/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** One-night touring jam-band at the Orange Peel — a true single-date draw (high urgency), danceable roots/jam sets give good main‑character energy but not ultra-rare, and the Orange Peel is a major regional venue with strong draw.

**AI Summary:** Roots-driven, danceable Americana and jam band sets blending fiddle, accordion, and groove-oriented guitar for high-energy crowd participation and dancing in an intimate club setting; ages 18 plus.

| Social / Meet People | 6/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** One-off visit from the Anglican Communion’s Secretary General makes this a rare, dignified ceremonial evening (high rarity and respectable caliber). It’s more contemplative than flashy—moderately unique—but not an Asheville‑style quirky event; it offers decent networking among clergy and community attendees.

**AI Summary:** A contemplative ceremonial evening led by Bishop Anthony Poggo, Secretary General of the Anglican Communion, honoring The Rev. Canon John Peterson with liturgical reflections, testimony, and community fellowship among clergy and lay leaders.

**Score Reasoning:** One-off stop on a tour (missable) featuring a niche reggae-dub take on Grateful Dead — high 'Asheville weird' appeal — playing a mid-sized regional venue (Asheville Music Hall) with solid jam/reggae draw.

**AI Summary:** Reggae-infused interpretations of Grateful Dead classics driven by dub-heavy bass, skanking guitar, and improvisational jam passages; expect groove-oriented, psychedelic dub grooves and dance-friendly live improvisation for fans of roots reggae and jam bands.

## #47 — Asheville Symphony: ALT ASO @ The Orange Peel

| Asheville Weird      | 6/10      |
| Social / Meet People | 7/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** One-night orchestral alt-rock set at The Orange Peel — a special, high-concept show that turns familiar songs into a late-night club experience. Strong draw because it’s at a major regional venue (Orange Peel) with creative flair and good social energy, but it’s not an every-decade once-in-a-lifetime spectacle nor peak-peculiar Asheville weirdness.

**AI Summary:** Orchestral reworkings of alt rock and indie favorites, with lush strings, brassy accents, and driving percussion transforming familiar songs into high-energy, late-night club sets for an intimate, rowdy audience.

| Social / Meet People | 6/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** Annual Division I conference championship in a large arena — high-stakes, packed crowd and bands make it a big local draw (limited multi-day run), but it’s a conventional sports event with low ‘Asheville weird’ character.

**AI Summary:** High-stakes Division I Southern Conference men's basketball final featuring intense, physical play and bracket deciding matchups in a packed arena atmosphere with bands and spirited cheering sections for traveling alumni.

| Asheville Weird      | -/10      |
| Social / Meet People | -/10      |

**Score Reasoning:** A one-night-only recital by internationally known mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard — rare and not easily repeatable locally (rarity=8). An elegant, high-quality art-song program in an intimate church setting offers strong 'main character' appeal without being gimmicky (unique=7). Leonard is a nationally recognized artist, so the draw is above typical local gigs though the venue is small and classical rather than arena-scale (magnitude=7).

**AI Summary:** Luminous mezzo soprano tones glide through a resonant church sanctuary in an intimate art song recital of Garcia-Lorca, Montsalvatge, Bizet, and traditional Spanish songs, backed by collaborative piano.

**Score Reasoning:** Danú is a touring, leading Irish ensemble playing a single St. Patrick’s date at the regional Brevard Music Center — a one-night, danceable holiday event with strong storytelling and high energy that’s a regional draw but not a global stadium headliner.

**AI Summary:** High-energy traditional Irish music with virtuosic ensemble playing, warm storytelling, and infectious rhythms that invite foot-stomping and dancing in a festive St. Patrick's Day atmosphere.
