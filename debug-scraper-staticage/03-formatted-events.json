    "title": "Advance Base / Moontype / i26connector",
    "description": "Advance Base is the melancholic soft rock recording project of Chicago, IL singer/songwriter Owen Ashworth (formerly of Casiotone for the Painfully Alone). Using a two-handed arsenal of electric piano, Omnichord, samplers, effect pedals & drum machines, Ashworth builds minimalist, heavy-hearted, & nostalgia-obsessed ballads around his conversational baritone. The warm, electronic sound of Advance Base has been described as \"lo-fi,\" \"depressed\" & \"weirdly uplifting.\" Moontype - So much of Moontype’s life-affirming magic is from the evolving confidence and relentless creative playfulness of its lead singer and bassist Margaret McCarthy. As the leader of the Chicago indie rock outfit, her music tackles soft and vulnerable emotions with striking clarity and immersive, unorthodox melodies. Their second album, I Let The Wind Push Down On Me, serves as a reinvention for the band—not just for their new and expanded lineup—but for how McCarthy navigates the changes in her own life and the messy feelings she sings about. Out May 23 via Orindal Records, the LP is a patient document of feeling things out, being easy on yourself, and finding the beauty in small moments. w/ i26connector - Asheville southern rock country goth",
