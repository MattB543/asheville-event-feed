This musical journey begins with a deep connection between electronics and live musicians, ignited by a passion for multi-cultural rhythms that echo across the festival scene Their odyssey into the realms of Funk, Latin, Cuban, and Afrobeat reads like a musical adventure, spawned from encounters with diverse cultures while on the road and under the influence of vinyl treasures unearthed in record shops scattered across the nation. At the core of Electro Lust beats the hearts of Grammy Award-winning artists from Asheville, NC's musical scene - Yo Mama's Big Fat Booty Band, The Fritz, Empire Strikes Brass, & Marcus King Band. Step into the soundwaves of Electro Lust, and suddenly you're whisked away, careening from the neon-lit confines of a Miami nightclub, drifting to the sun-soaked sands of a Brazilian beach, and finally landing amidst the vibrant chaos of Cuban streets. All the while, the soundtrack to this journey is an eclectic hip-hop mix tape, a melodic manifesto that defies convention and invites you to lose yourself in the raw energy of the Electro Lust experience. Strap in and let the music guide you through this electrifying tapestry of sound and sensation. AUSPICIOUS GOLDEN FISH Swimming in an ocean of sound, Auspicious Golden Fish weaves together searing guitar riffs, hypnotic synth textures, and deep funk grooves into a transcendent musical experience. Guitarist/producer Jamie Hendrickson (The Fritz/ElectroLust) assembles a revolving lineup of all-star musicians that bring his compositions to life. The result is a sonic journey-one that invites listeners to dissolve the ego, embrace the present moment, and dance into higher states of consciousness.",

    "description": "ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY THE NEW VARIANTS The New Variants play your hard rock favorites: Zep, AC/DC, ZZ Top, VH, Skynyrd and Sabbath. We're rock and roll veterans assembled from regional groups over the last 20 years. A good time is guaranteed. JESSE VELVET Jesse Velvet crafts a dynamic fusion of funk, rock, and psychedelic exploration, powered by blazing guitar solos, slick keyboard work, deep-pocket bass lines, and an infectious dual-percussion groove. This Asheville-based sextet unites veteran players from Pyletribe, Scratchdog Stringband, Get Right Band and Pronounced Heroes, delivering original compositions that range from soul-drenched gritty funk and feel-good grooves to face-melting rock anthems. While rooted in tight songcraft, Jesse Velvet isn't afraid to stretch out into uncharted territory, with instrumental journeys that showcase the band's growing appetite for psychedelic exploration. Their recent single \"Jeans\" perfectly captures their essence - soulful vocals and playful lyrics wrapped in a serious musical punch. With the addition of percussion expanding their sound, the band continues to evolve, bringing new rhythmic dimensions to keep the dance floor moving. Currently, Jesse Velvet is preparing to release their first live album in early 2026, capturing the raw energy and musical interplay that's making them a standout in the WNC music scene. Whether laying down hard-hitting rock grooves or diving into improvisational passages, Jesse Velvet delivers a fresh sound that's both adventurous and accessible. ANDREW THELSTON BAND The Andrew Thelston Band, voted #1 favorite rock band in the 2023 Best of WNC contest by Mountain Xpress, has been stunning audiences in the WNC region (and beyond) for 5 years. Frontman Thelston, voted #1 best guitarist in the same competition, is the creative force, bringing high-energy, funk-infused original rock n' roll that draws influence from Prince, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Led Zeppelin, and Queen. In 2019, Thelston's original music was featured on the hit Netflix show \"Lucifer.\" Thelston is widely known for his guitar virtuosity and soaring vocals, and leads the 4-piece band with a dynamic stage presence. Bassist Roddy Wilder and drummer Jeff Lott create a rock solid rhythm for Thelston's guitar and vocals. Singer-songwriter/keyboardist Carrie Morrison fills out the band's sound with powerhouse vocals and technical prowess.",

    "description": "ALL AGES SEATED SHOW SONGWRITERS ROLLER DERBY SHOWCASE The Songwriters Roller Derby Showcase, presented by the Asheville Songwriters Association, is a quarterly music show with no roller skates included - just four performers \"rollin' out the songs, elbows-n-all.\" Curated and hosted by Thomas Kozak and Jodi John Pippin, each \"Derby Night\" at The Grey Eagle will showcase the craft of songwriting in an intimate and welcoming setting. As an added element of the Songwriters Roller Derby Showcase, a surprise guest will join the performers on stage for interactive, on-the-spot commentary ~ a \"look under the hood of the songwriting process\" of sorts. The audience will have a chance to share comments as well, if they are inspired to do so. For most of the evening, the songwriters will perform finished songs, but they will also each share a brand new song that has not yet been performed on stage. Come support the songwriters as they show their vulnerable side and help nurture the art and craft of songwriting in the region and beyond. The performers for this 2nd Derby are:Will Hartz - A born entertainer and a multi instrumentalist, Will Hartz has been putting on a show for all to see before he could speak. With Appalachian funk and southern soul pouring through his fingertips, Will is best known for his ability to grab the attention of any and all audiences with his refined stylistic performances. Will started playing piano at the age of 8, later translating into years of musical theatre and a BA in musical performance. Andrea Rosal - Andrea picked up a guitar at age 40, started writing soon after and was hooked. The 2024 winner of Womansong of Asheville's inaugural songwriting competition, Andrea has written her way through a global pandemic, cancer, parenting two kids, Hurricane Helene, and all the ups and downs of everyday life. Jackson Grimm - Jackson Grimm is an accomplished and respected band leader, multi-instrumentalist and teacher in the Western North Carolina music community. His songs marry pop melodies with the lonesome sound of Appalachian music. Grimm won the 2025 LEAF Songwriting competition and has been a 2 year finalist for the Songwriter Serenade. He has shared the stage with and opened up for acts such as Molly Tuttle, Sierra Ferrell, Shadowgrass, the Wilder Flower, Arlo Guthrie, Tim Grimm, Ben Bedford, Ordinary Elephant, Nathan Evans Fox, and more.Jane Kramer - Jane Kramer has garnered international recognition for the heartrending originality of her vocals and for the heavy-hitting lyrical eloquence of her songwriting. With deep roots in the musical traditions, culture and lore of beloved Appalachia, Kramer's songs are introspective, gracefully gritty & fiercely memorable. A former social worker, domestic violence crisis counselor and avid humanitarian, Kramer continues to perform and teach about the songwriting process in prisons, shelters for the unhoused, programs for at-risk youth, hospitals and even animal rescues, sharing her message of music as a powerful tool for healing, connection and compassion. Quoted as \"...an artist on the rise\" by acclaimed American songwriter Mary Gauthier, Kramer has performed with Joan Osborne, Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls, The Steep Canyon Rangers, Sarah Siskind, Malcolm Holcombe, Josh Goforth, and Shawn Mullins.",

Tix on sale now, get 'em while they're hot (get it? hot? cause it's a summer thing?). The Get Right Band is a psychedelic indie rock group committed to relentlessly following their muses to honest self-expression, to whatever excites them and pushes them into unexplored territory, to capturing some version of truth. American Songwriter writes that the Asheville, NC based group, \"filters 60's/70's psychedelia and 90's alternative rock through a modern lens-as if Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and Nirvana co-wrote an album produced by Danger Mouse and Dan Auerbach.\" The Get Right Band formed in 2011, built around the musical brotherhood that guitarist/singer/songwriter Silas Durocher and bassist Jesse Gentry have formed playing music together since middle school. Durocher, who is a trained composer and has been commissioned to write for symphonies and chamber groups, has guitar chops that can soothe or rage, with a charismatic swagger as frontman and singer. Gentry's virtuosic bass playing \"catapults from elastic to nasty\" (The Mountain Xpress). Completing the team is drummer extraordinaire Jaze Uries, who is also a singer, songwriter, producer, photographer, and DJ, and keys legend Chuck Lichtenberger, whose incredible playing has been a staple of the Asheville music scene for years. GRB has defined their sound through constant evolution, building to the hook-driven, synth-heavy pop/rock/psych band they are today. The Huffington Post writes, \"their songs are infectious and take you immediately to a place. The lyrics are smart and bear weight.\" SUPATIGHT",

Born and raised in Richmond, VA and now living in Nashville, her raw songwriting and captivating covers have won over fans and critics alike. Her debut album Rhinestoned-which features breakout hit \"Johnny Moonshine\"-was released last year via Thirty Tigers and Antone's own label Love Big to widespread acclaim. Antone has gone on to tour alongside and share stages with Megan Moroney, 49 Winchester, Ella Langley, Brent Cobb, Ian Munsick, Marty Stuart, The Red Clay Strays and more. With her band the Rhinestones, she has appeared at major festivals including Under The Big Sky, ACL Fest and Windy City Smokeout. A songwriter since the age of 16, Antone has made music her full-time job since leaving college in late 2021. More from Antone is imminent. AVA HALL Ava Hall is a rising singer-songwriter whose timeless voice and heartfelt lyrics are already turning industry heads. Rooted in the Detroit area, Ava's story is shaped by a blend of grit and grace. Her father was raised on Detroit's iconic 8 Mile and built a successful career as a real estate executive, while her mother poured her heart into raising their children with unwavering love, faith, and strength after a career as an executive in the automotive industry. That balance of resilience and refinement shows up in Ava's music, where classic storytelling meets contemporary authenticity.A senior at Belmont University majoring in Songwriting, Ava graduates this year with distinction-not only for her talent but for breaking new ground. She is the very first student chosen by Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee Ashley Gorley to serve as his apprentice in a newly launched mentorship program, signaling early recognition of Ava's potential to shape the next chapter of country music.Raised on a soundtrack of Frank Sinatra and Dolly Parton, Ava developed an ear for melody and a voice that sounds as though it was plucked from a bygone era. Her vocals are rich, emotional, and unmistakably country-rooted in tradition but carried by fresh perspective. Faith-driven and deeply connected to her close-knit family, Ava is a twin and big sister, roles that have shaped her grounded outlook and storytelling voice.Her debut single, \"Georgia Heat,\" written entirely by Ava, was quickly recognized by curators and added to Spotify's Fresh Finds Country and Apple Music's Country Risers playlists-two platforms known for spotlighting the genre's next generation. Her upcoming single, \"What About Yours,\" co-written with breakout hitmaker Johnny Clawson, is poised to further solidify her arrival.Whether writing about heartbreak, home, or hope, Ava brings a rare sincerity to everything she does. With a debut EP on the horizon and support from some of the industry's most trusted names, she's not just chasing country music dreams-she's living them, one honest lyric at a time.",

For some, there comes a moment when Robert Zimmerman becomes Bob Dylan, when Reginald Dwight becomes Elton John, when David Robert Jones becomes David Bowie, when Ali Ibrahim becomes Ali Farka- it's a moment, when such an artist leaves behind the comforts of history in search of boundless expression- a moment when they metaphorically move out of their home, stepping into the unknown, and surrendering to the wild embrace of their muse. This chapter of my journey mirrors that kind of transformation. My new band, The Jet Stone Conspiracy, is the culmination of my rebirth- It's a surrender to the currents of free expression- an invitation to explore new realms of sound, movement, and poetry. The first mission of this new chapter is to come visit you with my band and share the songs from Tales of America, Tales of Isolation, and Spanish Villager No:3- all brought to life for the first time in a full-band setting. This will be my first time touring with a band- an invitation to experience with you the music that has led us to this point, in an expanded and dynamic form, and to hear the new material I'm exploring for the upcoming debut release of The Jet Stone Conspiracy. Much love,JS Born in Nairobi and reborn in America, J.S. (Jet Stone) Ondara's path has always been one of restless searching - from discovering Bob Dylan in a teenage dispute to teaching himself guitar after moving to Minneapolis alone, eventually earning a Grammy nomination for his debut album Tales of America and sharing stages with Neil Young, The Lumineers, and Lindsey Buckingham. This fall, Ondara will embark on the first full-band tour of his career. This special run is more than just a series of concerts; it's an invitation into a world rebuilt from the ground up. A chance to witness a rare moment of transformation in real time. Each night, Ondara, now performing as Jet Stone, will breathe new life into beloved songs from his catalog while offering a first look at new material from his upcoming debut as The Jet Stone Conspiracy. THE MONTVALES Born and raised in Knoxville, TN, Sally Buice and Molly Rochelson of The Montvales spent much of their formative years busking amidst the Elvis impersonators and musical saw players of the town's Market Square, honing their uniquely boisterous harmonies and perfecting the art of people-watching. Some fifteen years later, the two are still at it-maintaining their study of the robust chaos of the commons as they tour the country playing their descriptive, textured songs on the self-described \"feral outskirts of country music.\"",

Brimming with the grit and depth that's always defined his output, Pale, Through the Window ultimately affirms Kelly as one of modern music's most astute observers of the human heart and spirit. The follow-up to The Weakness-a 2023 release that earned major acclaim from the likes of Rolling Stone, The New York Times, NPR and led to his appearance on \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\"-Pale, Through the Window finds Kelly reuniting with his longtime collaborator Jarrad K, who also helmed production on Dying Star and 2020's Shape & Destroy. The first body of work he's recorded with his longtime touring band, the album centers on a singular sonic palette that often merges synth with pedal-steel guitar while fully embracing Kelly's ardent love of classic pop-punk and emo-ultimately bringing a raw and potent energy to his soul-searching songwriting. Over the course of Pale, Through the Window's 13 songs, Kelly offers up everything from the somber rumination of the LP's title track and the rueful longing of \"Twisted Root\" (an intimate look at his history with addiction) to the radiant open-heartedness of love songs like \"Waiting to Love You\" and \"Wayside\" (a euphoric but unvarnished portrait of love against the backdrop of a world in flames). And in sharing such an all-embracing account of his journey to acceptance and peace, he aspires to provide others with the courage to persevere through their own personal chaos. \"If someone's struggling with doubt or hopelessness because of the state of the world or their relationship with God or with themselves, I hope this record leaves them with the sense that it can be okay and that love truly is the most powerful force we have available to us,\" says Kelly. \"I also hope they feel at least a sliver of the freedom and joy I felt in writing these songs-even if they're just having a good time bobbing their head to 'Waiting to Love You,' I want everyone to be reminded that the world can be a joyful place.\" verygently verygently is the collective force of three established Nashville singer-songwriters-Drew Erwin, Joey Hendricks, and Tristan Bushman-who came together in early 2024. With tours alongside Augustana, The Band Camino, and The Fray, combined with their debut EP, the band quickly turned heads thanks to their high-energy live shows and songs that blend wit and vulnerability, weaving heartache with the undeniable charm of three best friends sharing the stage.",

    "description": "ALL AGES SEATED SHOW FRED EAGLESMITH Fred Eaglesmith, the Canadian singer-songwriter and roots music icon, has spent over five decades carving out a singular path in the music world. Known for his raw, storytelling lyrics, gravelly voice, and unapologetic independence, Eaglesmith has become a cult hero to fans of Americana, folk, and country music. Born in rural Ontario in 1957, he ran away from home at 15, hopping freight trains and living a nomadic life that would later fuel the vivid, working-class narratives in his songs. With a career spanning more than 25 albums, Eaglesmith has earned a reputation as a prolific and uncompromising artist. His songs, often laced with wit, heartbreak, and a touch of rebellion, have been covered by legends like Toby Keith, Alan Jackson, Miranda Lambert and countless more. Tracks like \"Time to Get a Gun\" and \"Freight Train\" have become anthems for the disenfranchised, while his live performances- equal parts rock show and revival meeting- have cemented his status as a must-see act. Eaglesmith, along with his multi-instrumental wife, Tif Ginn, have teamed up with a new band, The Velvet Frogs, injecting fresh energy into their timeless sound. The Velvet Frogs bring a dynamic, genre-blurring edge to Eaglesmith's music, blending his signature rootsy grit with psychedelic undertones and a dash of rock 'n' roll swagger. Together, they're reimagining his classic tunes and introducing new material that proves Eaglesmith is as vital and inventive as ever. No longer a road warrior, Eaglesmith is now only playing select and curated dates, as a duo with Tif Ginn, as well as with The Velvet Frogs. He continues to push boundaries, defy expectations, and remind us why he's one of the most enduring and enigmatic figures in modern music. Whether you're a longtime devotee or a newcomer to his world, one things for sure: Fred Eaglesmith is still writing his story, one unforgettable song at a time.",

    "description": "ALL AGESPARTIALLY SEATED SHOW (guaranteed seating AND standing room only tickets are available at checkout) CHATHAM COUNTY LINE Launched a little more than twenty years ago in Raleigh, North Carolina, Chatham County Line built a devoted local following on the strength of their genre-bending live show-an intoxicating blend of bluegrass, folk, country, and rock and roll-before breaking out internationally with their 2003 self-titled debut. In the years to come, the band would go on to release eight more critically acclaimed studio albums, top the Billboard Bluegrass Chart four times, collaborate with the likes of Judy Collins, Sharon Van Etten, and Norwegian star Jonas Fjeld, earn two gold records in Norway (where they were also twice nominated for the Spellemannprisen, Norway's equivalent of a Grammy), and share bills with everyone from Guy Clark and Lyle Lovett to Steve Martin & Martin Short and The Avett Brothers. NPR hailed the group as \"a bridge between bluegrass traditions and a fresh interpretation of those influences,\" while Uncut lauded their \"powerful melodies and gorgeous harmonies,\" and Pitchfork dubbed their music \"timeless.\" The band's latest release, Hiyo, marks the band's first release since the departure of their longtime banjo player and serves as something of a reintroduction to the roots stalwarts, complete with new sounds, new collaborators, and a whole new lease on life. Recorded at Asheville's Echo Mountain studio with co-producer/engineer Rachael Moore (Kacey Musgraves, Robert Plant and Alison Krauss), the collection finds the trio-Dave Wilson (lead singer/guitarist), John Teer (fiddle/mandolin) and Greg Readling (bass/pedal steel), embracing change at every turn, experimenting with fresh sonic palettes and innovative approaches to their core instrumentation. The songwriting remains classic Chatham County Line here-rich, evocative tales of love and heartbreak, joy and sorrow, righteousness and revenge-but the settings have evolved to incorporate synthesizers, drum machines, and more electric guitar and percussion than ever before. Given the group's string band roots and decades spent singing around a single microphone, the results are nothing short of revelatory, taking an enduring sound and injecting it with a thrilling new spirit of discovery and vitality.",

He has toured as the hand-picked opener for Tenacious D, Tim & Eric, and Faith No More, appeared on TV shows ranging from Tim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job! to Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and worked extensively with Tom Green on his internet talk show. Among his dozen or so albums and DVDs is the new LP release Neil Hamburger Present: Seasonal Depression Suite. \"A phlegm-filled sack of putrid self-loathing, Neil Hamburger is the perfect satire of a slick, professional nightclub comedian. If you've ever suspected that behind the glossy veneer of fake bonhomie of those perma-smile acts lies an ugly, embittered, grotesque soul - well Hamburger is that demon made flesh. In some living Sisyphean hell, every night he dons his tuxedo, greases down his hair and ploughs through the vile set that disgusts even him, just so he can earn a three-piece chicken dinner. His contempt for his own pitiful existence is surpassed only for his contempt for the audience who compel him trudge through his despicable cavalcade of jokes. And my, these gags are certainly not for the faint of heart, as he plumbs the depths of depravity for the sake of a laugh.\" - Chortle (UK) \"Hamburger is the clapped-out husk of a decorous Southern gentleman, now coughing in painful hacks, suppurating filth through his tuxedo, and her to tip a slurry of abuse all over celebrity and modern life.a combination of malignance and desiccated vaudeville.\" - The Guardian (UK) \"Neil Hamburger remains the greatest comedian I've seen the greater majority of an audience walk out on.... No one was leaving their seats this evening though, as this peerless performer shocked and delighted in equal measure.... On the road for 12 years with scarcely a day off, Hamburger is a condemned showbiz lag, doomed to perform his antagonistic anti-comedy to potential hostility forever.\" - The Scotsman (UK) \"A brilliantly awful persona of an old-school, C-list funnyman - the kind with an ill-fitting tuxedo and an enormous, greasy combover - on a very bad night. Neil Hamburger toys with an audience's expectations (and patience), and indeed his act is a kind of rude commentary on stand-up comedy altogether.\" - New York Times",

    "description": "ALL AGES SEATED SHOW LIMITED NUMBER OF PREMIUM SEATING TICKETS AVAILABLE WILLIS ALAN RAMSEY Over 50 years after the release of his wildly influential self-titled album on Leon Russell's Shelter Records, Willis Alan Ramsey returns to touring. Ramsey's debut in 1972 earned scores of accolades from arti-sts ranging from The Allman Brothers to Lyle Lovett. The album was mined by many artists for their o_wn recordings including Jimmy Buffett's \"The Ballad of Spider John\", Jimmie Dale Gilmore's \"Goodbye Old Missoula\", Shawn Colvin's \"Satin Sheets\", Captain & Tennille's \"Muskrat Candlelight/Love\", Jerry Jeff Walker's \"Northeast Texas Women\", Waylon Jennings' \"Satin Sheets\", New Grass Revival's \"Watermelon Man\", and many more. Since that landmark first release, Ramsey has toured only occasionally, spending time instead with his family, honing his craft in Austin, Nashville and London, educating himself in the science of audio recording and composing new songs. His new material has received critical acclaim, including Lyle Lovett's recordings of \"Sleepwalkin\"', \"North Dakota\" and \"That's Right (You're Not From Texas\"), as well as Eric Clapton's recording of\"Positively\". Ramsey's infrequent personal appearances always gamer excitement among some of the top critics in the country as well as from his fellow artists: \"His cozy, orderly, tiny-detail songs express a willful turnabout from hippie chaos, a visceral reaction particular to the early 1970's. His songs are sweet, emotionally guarded and often musically complex, fitting strains of melody together that seem as if they ought not connect, expertly using rhythmic displacement as the words and chords unspool .... Perfection is terrifying, and some of these songs felt spooky.\" - Ben Ratliff, The New York Times \"You might have not seen him lately, but if you've listened to Shawn, Lyle or Jimmie Dale, you've heard him.\" - John T. Davis, The Austin American Statesman \"Even if Ramsey had made a dozen more albums, this would still be the record that no home should be without.\" - No Depression \"When I got his record, I loved everything on it. I heard some Flannery O'Connor and William Faulkner in there. It was a little more literary than most of the Texas stuff.\" -Jimmy Buffett \"Everybody owned his record when I lived in Austin. That's because it's great and them Texans knew it. I think Lyle's great, but tell me he didn't learn something from Willis.\" - Shawn Colvin \"I learned every song off his record. I went to see him every time he played, got tennis shoes like his. I wanted to be Willis Alan Ramsey.\" -Lyle Lovett",

Shambolic guitars are offset by flute pads, bleary poetry is set against a Motown rhythm section, a song about Jerry Garcia and First Lady Betty Ford fades out with a drum solo, like if Talk Talk came from a dingy Philadelphia basement, and was fronted by James Tate. Songwriter Dan Wriggins' ragged baritone cuts through eleven murky, swirling country-rock songs with profound lyrical substance and sincerity. Like an alarm clock incorporated into the edge of a dream, Caveman Wakes Up belongs equally to the conscious and subconscious mind, fraught with background, steeped in reference and experimentation, delivered casually and as a dire warning, dedicated, above all, to music's creative soul. Over the years, dedication has paid off. Friendship has become a kind of reverse supergroup, wherein the band itself and each individual member is located centrally in an increasingly prominent scene of young folk and country musicians and songwriters. Drummer Michael Cormier O'Leary leads the instrumental collective Hour and, along with bassist Jon Samuels, run Dear Life Records, home to friends and peers who count Friendship as a major influence, including MJ Lenderman, Florry, and Fust. (Samuels also plays lead guitar in MJ Lenderman and the Wind). Guitarist Peter Gill's band 2nd Grade records prolifically. Wriggins began writing the songs of Caveman Wakes Up on a downtuned classical guitar of Lenderman's, and finished on a barely-tuned piano in an apartment he shared with Sadurn's G DeGroot. In the summer of 2023, Wriggins had just left the Iowa Writers' Workshop, where his love for poetry and mistrust for the academic poetry world grew in tandem. A relationship fell apart, and Wriggins crashed for several weeks at Lenderman's and Wednesday's Karly Hartzman's home in North Carolina, where he recorded the first demos of \"Resident Evil,\" \"All Over the World,\" and \"Love Vape.\" Wriggins returned to Philadelphia, and the band got to work on new ideas, finally tracking the album in five days with engineer Jeff Ziegler (Mary Lattimore, War on Drugs). NATALIE JANE HILL Natalie Jane Hill's new record, Hopeful Woman, is composed of slender songs, life-sized, in which humans endeavor to reconcile themselves to wildernesses and cities; rearrange their rooms and open windows to be closer to the world outside and its choruses of frogs and crickets; attempt and fail to reach one another across a kitchen table; weather natural disaster. If something we might deign to call self-discovery emerges over the course of these narratives, it owes in no small part to the scale of their scenes, to the modesty of their ambitions, in which tumult and adaptation and growth are metabolized through a body's gentle actions and reactions, its moments of quietude and observation and reflection. \"Into the current of life I will fly,\" Hill sings on Oranges, a song that would serve her well as a mission statement. \"Changing and loving and growing and trying.\"",

    "description": "ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY EMPIRE STRIKES BRASS \"Their shows are high energy and driven - powerful affairs that carry the audience through a full-range of emotions and often force the fans to look inward throughout - while still filling the building with love, acceptance, and hope.\" - Caleb Calhoun, Ashvegas.comEmpire Strikes Brass is a dynamic BrassFunkRock band hailing from Asheville, North Carolina. Their music resonates with a powerful message delivered through a captivating and larger-than-life sound. Fueled by a thumping rhythm section that sets the groove, the band's rich horn arrangements, performed by a robust horn section, add an extra layer of depth to both their original compositions and compelling covers, showcasing the evolution of ESB.Formed in 2012, Empire Strikes Brass started as a group of friends who loved playing New Orleans-inspired second-line and funk tunes infused with elements of rock and jam. Over time, they have transformed into a collective of incredibly talented musicians, singers, songwriters, and producers. The result is a fresh and authentic sound that seamlessly combines their diverse musical influences while staying true to their roots.The band boasts a remarkable lineup of artists, each bringing their own unique contribution to the table. From the rich vocals, and harmonious saxophone of Grammy Award-winning artist Debrissa McKinney (known for her work with Secret Agent 23 Skidoo) to the masterful keyboard and production skills of Lenny Pettinelli, the thunderous beats of drummer Nik Hope, the solid bass lines of JP Furnas, the melodic guitar riffs of Chris Porter, the soulful trumpet sounds of Alex Bradley, and the sky high notes of Tim Morgan on trumpet, the smooth trombone of Jacob Bruner, the vibrant saxophone of Pauly Juhl, and the versatile keyboard and percussion talents of Sean Donnelly, every member of ESB plays a crucial role in the band's success.Since their inception, Empire Strikes Brass has become a staple at various festivals across the USA, leaving a lasting impression with their infectious energy and electrifying performances. Their horn section has also had the honor of sharing the stage with esteemed acts like Shpongle Live Band, Umphrey's McGee, Papadosio, and many more iconic names in the funk and jam scene.Whether performing live or working on their studio recordings, Empire Strikes Brass emanates a strength and cohesiveness that is undeniable. Their debut album, \"Theme For A Celebration,\" was recorded at the renowned Echo Mountain Recording Studio in Asheville and received acclaim as one of the top 100 releases of the year by WNCW 88.7 radio in 2017. Following that success, their fierce follow-up release, \"Brassterpiece Theatre\" (2019), was also recorded at Echo, showcasing their continued growth and artistic prowess.

    "description": "ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY LANGHORNE SLIM For more than two decades, Langhorne Slim has been a fearless voice in modern Americana, known for his raw emotion and rule-breaking spirit. On his ninth album, The Dreamin' Kind, the Nashville-based songwriter plugs in his electric guitar and dives headfirst into big-hearted, 1970s-style rock & roll. Produced by Greta Van Fleet's Sam F. Kiszka, the record pairs power chords and soaring hooks with the vulnerable storytelling that's long defined Slim's work. \"It felt like I was blowing some old shit up so I could plant some new flowers,\" he says. \"I love folk music, but rock & roll tickles the same part of my soul. I wanted to explore that.\" The collaboration began after Slim opened for Greta Van Fleet, leading to loose, inspired sessions with Kiszka and drummer Danny Wagner. Together they built songs that move from the propulsive rush of \"Rock N Roll\" and the swagger of \"Haunted Man\" to the tender sweep of \"Dream Come True\" and \"Stealin' Time.\" Recorded over a year in Nashville, The Dreamin' Kind bridges Slim's rootsy past with a louder, more expansive present. It's a record of freedom and discovery, equally at home in rock clubs and around campfires - proof that Langhorne Slim, ever the dreamer, still finds new ground to break with every song.",

    "description": "ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY AMELIA DAY Amelia Day is a musical jack-of-all-trades. Standing at the intersection of folk, rock, and pop, Day blends heartfelt storytelling, raw delivery, and unforgettable melodies into music that feels both fresh and familiar - like rediscovering an old favorite. A self-described writer before anything else, her perceptive lyricism extends far beyond her 23 years, with lines reminiscent of songwriting greats like Joni Mitchell and Paul Simon. As the Spokesman-Review notes, Day has a signature style that features \"wordplay, double-meanings and rhythmic variations,\" with themes ranging from journeying into adulthood to climate change. Many of Day's songs are also shaped by her intimate relationships, where her queerness and candor take center stage. Day's upcoming EP EGO TRIP is her most personal project yet. Lead single \"Lady Los Angeles\" traces the sting of betrayal after discovering infidelity, while the rest of the EP takes listeners on an intimate journey through her grieving process. \"The character of 'Lady Los Angeles' is representative of my ex's obsession with attention and fame at all costs and my own fear of being seduced by those same temptations,\" Day explains. \"It felt like she was having an affair, not only with another person, but with the often-self-aggrandizing culture of Los Angeles itself.\" Born and raised in the small town of Sumner, Washington - the self-proclaimed \"Rhubarb Pie Capital of the World\" - Day has been drawn to music-making since she could walk. \"I had no idea what I was doing, but I had a toy ukulele and drum, and my parents had an upright piano that I would mess around on,\" she recalls. \"I could spend hours just playing around on the keys, making up little songs, which my piano teacher recognized and encouraged.\" By middle school, Day was already writing her own songs \"about myself and my (very angsty) preteen feelings.\" Once Day got to college, she began performing her originals publicly, though not without roadblocks. \"I had horrible stage fright up until mid-college,\" she admits. Starting with farmers markets and local restaurants, Day gradually built up the confidence and the following that would lead to sold-out shows in Seattle, Boston, and D.C., as well as festival appearances at Bumbershoot (\"one of my favorite sets I've ever played.there was a line of people outside waiting to get in!\"), Capitol Hill Block Party, Folklife Festival, and Seattle PrideFest - all on her own. \"I'm proud of getting to this point as an artist completely solo,\" Day says. Already boasting over a million streams on a number of songs, Amelia Day continues to prove herself as both a songwriter and performer, emerging as a voice destined to resonate for years to come.",

    "description": "- ALL AGES - STANDING ROOM ONLY TRAIN SONGZ: AN EVENING WITH THE ASHEVILLE MOUNTAIN BOYS By their name, you know where they are from, and by their sound, you know what they are about. The Asheville Mountain Boys are on a mission to capture not just the style but the spirit of traditional bluegrass. Asheville, NC has long been known for great music and its roots in bluegrass go back to the founding of the genre (Bill Monroe's first broadcast performance as the Bluegrass Boys was at Asheville radio station WWNC in 1938) A group that firmly stakes its claim to the tradition of the music from the area, The Asheville Mountain Boys spring onto the scene with a thought,\" What happened to bluegrass?\" It's not a disparaging one that condemns current styles in the genre but rather asks, \"Why do we love this music in the first place\" and answers with an approach that is true to the originators of the genre in the sense of both style and philosophy. Train Songz started as an Instagram meme page. As its audience grew, The Conductor and his trusty engineer Promontory Paul derailed the social media train and took their audience offline with a print fanzine. The first issue of Train Songz was released in January 2024, six months after the meme page got its start, and the zine-team has released quarterly issues since. This show, featuring traditional bluegrass from the Asheville Mountain Boys, will be a launch party for the ninth issue of Train Songz-and the first of 2026, our third year in publication. On top of the music, we'll inject the evening with some Train Songz sensibilities and welcome some friends who dye, bootleg, and peddle other such wares one might find \"on lot.\" We'll have offline-exclusive merchandise and zines, as well! Hope you can join us.",

It contains timbres and textures no other instrument can replicate, but most importantly, itʼs immensely powerful: One voice can spark an uprising, but many voices in unison create a movement. Nya Gazelle Brown, Sabrina Cunningham, and Piya Malik, the three women who front NYC punk-chic, discodelic band Say She She, understand how to wield such power. They soar above irresistible grooves, locking together in gorgeous three-part harmonies that cleverly disguise the feeling of righteous rebellion permeating their music. Theirs is a multi-pronged call to action: Move your body, expand your mind, and recognize your strength. Say She She, whose name pays homage to Nile Rodgers, made Cut & Rewind, their third record, almost immediately after wrapping the tours supporting 2023ʼs Silver. The bandʼs trajectory has skyrocketed over the past few years, earning praise from The Guardian, the LA Times, MOJO, and NPR, and touring with Thee Sacred Souls. They have performed at venues like the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles and the Roundhouse in London, as well as festivals including Glastonbury, Austin City Limits, and Pickathon. Theyʼve long mined the sounds of the '70s and '80s, citing Minnie Riperton, Rotary Connection, Liquid Liquid, and ESG as influences. Cut & Rewind expands their scope, incorporating elements of Lonnie Liston Smith and the Lijadu Sisters into their sonic palette while channeling the spirit of contemporaries like Lambrini Girls and Amyl and the Sniffers. It all combines into a psychedelic soundscape of pulsing disco beats, astral whistle tones, and earwormy melodies. Katz&ugrave; Oso Katz&ugrave; Oso is a Chicano artist born and raised in the heart of Los Angeles. His melodic vocals and contemporary sounds are infl uenced by his multicultural upbringing in East LA and Boyle Heights. After the release of his two buzzworthy harmonic EPs, Colour, and Pastel, Katz&ugrave; Oso takes us to another alternative dimension with his debut album, Tm&iacute;. Oso's album is a timeline portal into his hero's journey growing up in his Boyle Heights neighborhood. From the heart and soul he brings to life una historia de amor to escape the current reality and transcend into a melodic universe fi lled with synthesizer and upbeat tempos. Visually, our hero takes on the new alter ego with the Luchador mask, a symbolic representation of his roots and serves as an ode to his Chicano cultura.",

In addition to Elkington, it features the playing of Ben Whiteley (The Weather Station), Joe Westerlund (Bon Iver, Califone), and others. Blake Mills contributes guitars on several tracks.

Wrembel is a highly respected composer with original compositions featured in the acclaimed films Midnight in Paris (\"Bistro Fada\") and Vicky Cristina Barcelona (\"Big Brother\"). Midnight in Paris won the Grammy Award&reg; for \"Best Compilation Soundtrack.\" At the 2012 Academy Awards&reg;, Wrembel was handpicked by renowned composer Hans Zimmer to join his \"All Star Band\" performing alongside luminaries like Esperanza Spalding, Pharrell, and Shelia E. With an impressive discography of over 20 albums released under his name and the pseudonym, The Django Experiment, Wrembel released a triptych-- 3 CDs entitled Phase 1, 2 and 3--recorded with Canadian improvisational pianist Jean-Michel Pilc in April of 2024, receiving glowing press in Downbeat, Guitar Player Magazine, Acoustic Guitar Magazine, New York Jazz Record and more.

    "description": "ALL AGES SEATED SHOW LIMITED NUMBER OF PREMIUM SEATING TICKETS AVAILABLE SHELBY MEANS Born in the bluegrass of Kentucky and raised on Wyoming's high plains, Shelby Means is one of the foremost bassists in bluegrass, with nearly two decades of experience in bluegrass, folk, rock, Americana, and country outfits. Now based in Charleston, SC, Means spent a dozen years in Nashville, TN. During that time she performed most notably as a member of the GRAMMY&reg;-nominated all-women bluegrass band Della Mae. She later joined Molly Tuttle & Golden Highway on bass and vocals, earning her first GRAMMY&reg; win for their 2023 album, City of Gold. Means is a driving player with a deep pocket, a singular stage presence, and a magnetic, centered approach to the upright bass. Beyond her work on the instrument, she's also an accomplished songwriter and a heartfelt vocalist whose voice is rooted in tradition while authentically her own. With her debut solo music Means invites listeners to experience the same soulful presence and adventurous spirit she has built her career on. Her singing and playing has been heard across the country and around the world, from NPR's airwaves, the Grand Ole Opry, Bonnaroo, Telluride Bluegrass Festival, and Newport Folk to the U.S. Virgin Islands, Kazakhstan, Australia, and beyond. MAYA DE VITRY Originally from Lancaster, PA, Maya de Vitry is a Nashville-based artist whose music blurs the lines of folk, indie rock, and Americana. An admirer of the dedicated song craft of writers like John Prine, Gillian Welch, and Townes Van Zandt - and of the stirring vocals of artists like Bonnie Raitt and Nina Simone - Maya de Vitry's music invites listeners into a space of openness and connection. After a formative chapter with the roots-Americana trio The Stray Birds, she launched her solo career with the 2019 album Adaptations, earning praise from Rolling Stone Country, NPR Music, and No Depression. Since then, she has built a devoted following, drawn to both her recordings and her powerful live performances. Known for her magnetic voice and hard-won sense of purpose, Maya has toured in North America and Europe, supporting artists like The Wood Brothers, Aoife O'Donovan, John Craigie, and Mighty Poplar. Her songs have also appeared on albums by Molly Tuttle, Lindsay Lou, and Steve Poltz, and her skills as a multi-instrumentalist and harmony singer have contributed to many Nashville recordings. Her fourth full-length release in just six years, The Only Moment, is a 10-track testament to personal reinvention and creative growth. \"I'm not just making different music now. It feels like I'm breathing in a different atmosphere,\" she reflects on her evolution from The Stray Birds to her solo journey. Her sense of liberation is especially apparent in her live shows, which have become a space for spontaneity, peace, and freedom, often woven together with personal stories that connect the songs. \"After the show, I just want to know if I've helped you feel more free,\" Maya says. \"That's my unspoken agreement-to myself, my bandmates, and everyone in the audience.\"",

A marvel of interwoven musicianship and testament to the duo's singular camaraderie, the album encapsulates the two veteran guitarist-songwriters' mutual admiration and effortless compatibility as they swap and share nine new songs of dazzling dexterity and grace recorded almost entirely recorded on acoustic guitars. Though their initial objective had been all instrumental, the natural flow of the sessions led the duo to begin incorporating vocal tracks. Music at its most elemental, Celestun sees Carl Broemel and Tyler Ramsey stripping away artifice to unlock and explore deeply personal themes of wanderlust and familial love, of fellowship and communal adventure. \"We don't step on each other's toes,\" says Carl Broemel, \"we kind of fit together like puzzle pieces. Maybe that sounds grandiose, but that's how it feels to me when we're playing. We don't even have to talk about it.\" \"We just mesh together in a way that I can't even really explain,\" says Tyler Ramsey. \"I feel like there's some magical connection between our two things, it just makes me smile and satisfies some itch as far as things that I would like to hear on the music that I write. I think he feels the same way about what I do.

Meanwhile, Tyler Ramsey, has earned praise for his former role as songwriter and lead guitarist in Band of Horses as well as an evolving solo body of work that includes 2024's acclaimed New Lost Ages, hailed by Americana UK as \"a gentle indie-folk gem.\"",

    "description": "ALL AGES PARTIALLY SEATED SHOW (guaranteed seating AND standing room only tickets are available at checkout) DARRELL SCOTT Multi-Instrumentalist and Singer-Songwriter Darrell Scott mines and cultivates the everyday moment, taking the rote, menial, mundane, and allowing it to be surreal, ever poignant, and candidly honest, lilting, blooming, and resonating. The words he fosters allow us to make sense of the world, what is at stake here, and our place in it. And ultimately, Darrell knows the sole truth of life is that love is all that matters, that we don't always get it right, but that's the instinctive and requisite circuitous allure of things, why we forever chase it, and why it is held sacred. Darrell Scott comes from a musical family with a father who had him smitten with guitars by the age of 4, alongside a brother who played Jerry Reed style as well. From there, things only ramped up with literature and poetry endeavors while a student at Tufts University, along with playing his way through life. This would never change. After recently touring with Robert Plant and the Zac Brown Band (2 years with each), and producing albums for Malcolm Holcomb and Guy Clark and being named \"songwriter of the year\" for both ASCAP and NSAI, these days ﬁnd him roaming his Tennessee wilderness acreage hiking along the small river, creating delicious meals with food raised on his property and playing music. He often leads songwriting workshops to help people tell their own truths with their stories, and is as busy as always writing, producing, performing, and just plain fully immersing himself in life. WILL HOGE Will Hoge will release Sweet Misery, the Grammy-nominated artist's 15th studio album on Friday, August 22.On Sweet Misery, Hoge reminds listeners that he isn't afraid to break new ground - all while giving a keen nod to his rock and roll roots with the kind of grace and purpose that only comes with experience - without the baggage of predictability.In Will's own words - \"Following the re-recording and re-releases of Carousel and Blackbird On A Lonely Wire I found myself really wanting to make a louder, hooky, rock-n-roll band record again. Good stories, big choruses, shit to make you play it loud and drive fast with the windows down. I was without a band so I enlisted a crew of folks who I love - folks that I believed could really help bring out the bigger ideas in the songs. I hope folks will find some headphones and give it a good, loud listen. Top to bottom, the way albums should be listened to.\" Will Hoge has a career whose milestones include Number One hits, Grammy nods, major-label record deals, and hard-won independence. Years before Americana music received its own category at the Grammy Awards, Hoge was on the frontlines, helping to pilot and popularize the genre's blend of American roots music. In the current digital era dominated by influencers seeking shortcuts to stardom, Will Hoge proudly treads the scenic route, immersing himself in the journey rather than fixating on the destination.",

    "description": "ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY RATBOYS Despite its title, Ratboys' new album \"Singin' to an Empty Chair\" is not defined by what's missing. Rather, it's the beginning of an important dialogue with a close loved one vocalist Julia Steiner finds herself estranged from. The music on the band's sixth studio album - its first for New West Records - fills the space that person left behind with 11 songs showcasing Ratboys at the peak of their powers - twangy, effervescent, as confident as they've ever been, and perhaps more emotionally interrogative than ever before. The four-piece Chicago band followed up 2023's highly acclaimed \"The Window\" by reconvening with co-producer Chris Walla to begin tracking at a rural Wisconsin cabin before taking the songs to Steve Albini's famed Electrical Audio studios in Chicago and later to Rosebud Studio in Evanston, Illinois. The results veer from bubbly power-pop on \"Anywhere\" to irresistible post-country on \"Penny in the Lake,\" along with heart-piercing ballads like \"Just Want You to Know the Truth\" and an exhilarating detour into the extraterrestrial on \"Light Night Mountains All That,\" which Steiner dubs the band's mammoth \"wormhole jam.\" \"Singin' to an Empty Chair\" also marks the first Ratboys album written since Steiner began therapy, which the singer/lyricist credits for the clarity found across the album's unflinching examinations of relationship and self. Fittingly, as the album begins by extending a hand into the void, it concludes with a scene of serenity - all while weaving candid honesty, humor, chaos, and whimsy along the way. \"It's not all doom and gloom,\" Steiner says. \"The experience of making this record definitely gives me hope for whatever happens next.\" FLORRY For 'Sounds Like.' Florry's sophomore effort as a fully realized band, Francie Medosch and Co. decamped to Drop of Sun studios in the nest of the Blue Ridge Mountains to record with Asheville wunderkind Colin Miller, a critical voice behind the records of MJ Lenderman, Wednesday and Merce Lemon and a powerful songwriter in his own right. Three powerhouse days in late 2023 solidifi ed writing work done by the band earlier that summer in the now defunct Haw Creek compound under Miller's guiding suggestion. The result is a portrait of a ripping band cresting towards the height of their powers, uniquely equipped to capture a wildly loving, barn-burning camcorder clip of a turbulent trip with your best friends, without dipping into nostalgia bait. Lyrically, Medosch's utterances are both careful and excessive, the product of sifting through the rubble of classic good-time media, and fi nding what works for both her and her community to reach the heights of abandon.\"The Jackass theme song was actually a really big influence on the new album.\"",

    "description": "ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY TWEN Twen is a van-lifeing rock band that emerged onto the east coast music scene in 2017 with their distinct blend of shoegaze, indie rock, and post-punk influences. Though the band was formed in 2016 by lead vocalist Jane Fitzimmons and guitarist Ian Rollins Jones, their emergence post-pandemic has marked the beginning of what is essentially an entirely new project; save for their keeping the name \"Twen\". This latest chapter is marked by the band booking their own tours, designing and screen printing their own merch, directing and editing their own music videos, and producing and mixing their own albums; all to a degree which would seem impossible to believe, if you didn't know that they also built their own mobile-home from scratch and have been living in it, traversing the North American continent for the past 3 years. The duo-led 5 piece are readying their 3rd LP to be released in 2024, but have already debuted lead single 'SeaStar'; an early 00's throwback to Southern California beach anthems that finds the band further evolving from the coy, shoegaze aesthetics of 'Awestruck' (2019) - to a modern classicism; characterized on their 2nd LP 'One Stop Shop' (2022) by political (yet hopeful) lyrics, indelible hooks and a home-grown sonic mix that rewards the listener with each subsequent spin. With over 350 shows under their belt across North America and Europe, including arena appearances supporting Rainbow Kitten Surprise, Wet Leg, Whitney, Tacocat, & White Reaper, Twen's live show exhibits their all-around relevance as a DIY rock band thriving in the digital age.",

    "description": "ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY JORDANA Jordana's music has always possessed a unique sense of place. You can hear the stillness of a Kansas bedroom on her 2020 debut Classical Notions. Humid late night New York walks on her double EP Something To Say To You. There's the kaleidoscopic otherworldliness of Summer's Over, her collab release with TV Girl. The unmistakable sunshine of LA on 2024's Lively Premonitions. But on her new semi self-titled project, Jordanaland, the 25-year-old songwriter has officially crafted a place all her own. \"Jordanaland is definitely an escape from Americaland. It looks a lot like LA in the videos.for some reason. Weird,\" muses Jordana. \"But it's wherever you want it to be, just close your eyes.\" Recorded with her friends Charlie Kilgore & Julian Kaufman of offkilter pop group MICHELLE, the EP drops Jordana in her most brightly-colored surroundings yet. Mixed by a pair of Grammy Award winners in Olli Jacobs (Kendrick Lamar, Taylor Swift, beabadoobee) & David Pizzimenti (Ella Mai, Ed Sheeren, Travis Scott), these songs soar with a sonic confidence that has previously only made occasional appearances in her discography. \"Pop music was definitely the goal,\" says Jordana. \"Self assured, confident pop. I think the evolution came from becoming more comfortable with my voice, a more established sound, and also looking up to artists who let it all out in that way. I was pretty intimidated at first, because I love MICHELLE. They're powerhouses. So I tried leaning into their energy, and I'm in love with what we made.\" Of course, if her catalog is any indication, this might simply be a pitstop in a world of pop, but it's a fully realized one. And in Jordanaland, she's running for president. And she's ruling with a very adorable iron fist. At the same time, the EP is littered with picture-perfect love songs & down bad kissoffs. The revved-up jangle pop of \"Burning Me Down\" and yearning ballad \"I Wanna Be\" are universal tracks about relationships, while the lithe \"Blouse\" is about one-sided romantic intimacy and wondering if there's potential for more. Jordana has come a long way from that still Kansas bedroom in 2020, reinventing herself and her surroundings multiple times over. \"It does feel liberating,\" says Jordana, of her reputation as a genre chameleon. \"There's no expectation for me, or at least no expectation I'm paying attention to. I get to try new things all the time. It's kind of like going to a theme park and seeing a bunch of your favorite rides and running over to each of them in excitement - each ride offers so many different feelings and experiences, that it's so hard to choose only one to ride for the rest of the day.\" If you want to find her today, she's riding a dazzling rollercoaster named Jordanaland. Tomorrow? We'll have to wait and see where the journey leads. the booyah! kids The booyah! kids are a three piece indie outfit from NYC. Julian, Aidan, and Emma sing together, telling stories from their bedrooms. A good booyah song should feel like a friend of yours.",

    "description": "ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY JOHN CRAIGIE For over a decade, John Craigie has made music that brings people in, not with spectacle but with sincerity and songs that feel like conversations. His new album I Swam Here, out February 6, 2026 on Zabriskie Point Records, was written and produced by Craigie and recorded between New Orleans and Astoria. Seven tracks were cut at Deslonde St Studios with musicians handpicked by Sam Doores of The Deslondes, including Howe Pearson, Max Bien Khan, Jonny Campos, and a guest appearance from Desiree Cannon. Longtime collaborator Anna Moss appears across much of the record. The remaining tracks were finished at the Rope Room in Astoria, carrying over the same spirit and palette. The cover art, painted by Brittany Schall, nods to the design of mid century samba and jazz records. The album's singles trace the path of its making. \"Fire Season,\" engineered by Bart Budwig, was one of the first songs written and features Cooper Trail, Nevada Sowle, Luke Ydstie, and Jamie Greenan. \"Dry Land\" was reworked in Astoria after early New Orleans sessions didn't feel right. \"Edna Strange,\" inspired by Marty Robbins, is the only track where Craigie plays steel string acoustic, with Max Bien Khan on nylon string leads and a trio vocal arrangement in place of Moss's harmonies. Following 2024's Pagan Church with TK & The Holy Know-Nothings, which spent six weeks at #1 on the Americana Albums chart, I Swam Here feels both expansive and intimate, shaped by the musical history of the Gulf Coast and the stillness of the Pacific Northwest. Craigie remains a tireless live performer, touring throughout the U.S., Europe, and Australia, appearing at festivals like Newport Folk, Pickathon, Edmonton Folk Festival, and High Sierra, and sharing the stage with artists such as Langhorne Slim, Sierra Hull, Gregory Alan Isakov, Brett Dennen, and Jack Johnson. I Swam Here is a grounded, collaborative step forward, blending New Orleans grit with Pacific Northwest quiet, and showing a songwriter still widening the world of his music. ANTHONY DA COSTA Anthony da Costa played his first paid gig at 14 in Pleasantville, NY, and by 16 was the youngest-ever winner of the Kerrville and Falcon Ridge Folk Festival songwriting competitions. As a teenager, he toured widely, sharing stages with artists like Loretta Lynn, Judy Collins, Big Thief, and The Milk Carton Kids.Over the years, he's become a sought-after guitarist and harmony singer, supporting Sarah Jarosz, Aoife O'Donovan, Molly Tuttle, Yola, and Joy Williams (The Civil Wars). His work has brought him to major stages including the Hollywood Bowl, Bonnaroo, and Newport Folk Festival, plus appearances on Conan and Jimmy Kimmel Live. He has released about a dozen albums and several EPs of his own.His upcoming album, The No Send Letter, is his 12th and his most personal. Self-produced and recorded between Pleasantville Recording and a barn studio in Virginia, it documents a difficult and transformative breakup. Captured across digital, reel-to-reel, and cassette formats, the album reflects a period of deep healing and renewed connection with his Nashville community, resulting in some of his most emotionally direct and sonically adventurous work.",

    "description": "ALL AGES SEATED SHOW LIMITED NUMBER OF PREMIUM SEATING TICKETS AVAILABLE EMILY SCOTT ROBINSON \"Colorado singer-songwriter Emily Scott Robinson mixes folk and country with gorgeous, clear-eyed examinations of faith, hope and regret.\" - NPR On her third album with Oh Boy Records, and her fifth since beginning her career a decade ago, Emily Scott Robinson once again unveils her mastery as a performer and storyteller. With her 2026 release Appalachia - recorded at Dreamland Recording Studios with Grammy-nominated producer Josh Kaufman - Robinson opens herself up to experimentation and sings in her crystal-clear voice about resilience, love, grief and hope. Robinson's talent is no surprise to the music industry - she's now a veteran touring artist, both at home and abroad. Her records Traveling Mercies (2019) and American Siren (2021) each landed high on Rolling Stone's \"Best Country and Americana Albums\" and Stereogum's \"10 Best Country Albums\" year-end lists. She's been lauded by the Washington Post, Billboard, American Songwriter and No Depression, and earned the 19th spot on NPR's \"100 Best Songs of 2021\" with her song \"Let 'Em Burn.\" It was her 2020 release \"The Time for Flowers,\" an anthem of hope recorded at home in the midst of the global pandemic, that caught the attention of Oh Boy Records, the independent label founded by John Prine in 1981. Robinson jumped at the opportunity to join the free-spirited and beloved record label carrying on her hero's legacy. Robinson believes the songs on Appalachia are the best she's ever written - she sings about her grandmother slipping into dementia, a cash-only saloon full of characters, and gratitude for life, despite its hardships. The album features a duet with Grammy winner John Paul White that celebrates the kind of love that comes with scars and age, and a hymn for anyone who's ever failed or fallen short. \"There's this thing I do with every record I make,\" she says. \"I knit a prayer into it, and I ask for all these songs to find their way to everyone who needs them. I ask these songs to be of service, to help people find and experience joy.\"",

Della Mae is one such band. The GRAMMY-nominated string band was founded in 2010 and over the next decade and a half they've demonstrated to the roots music world, once and for all, that a band of all women is not, nor has ever been, a mere novelty. They remain at the forefront of the explosion of women instrumentalists and all-women acts in roots music and their impact is striking and measurable - not just in North America, but around the globe. Now 15 years since their origin, Della Mae can boast their strongest lineup yet. Founders Kimber Ludiker and Celia Woodsmith are joined by guitarist and songwriter Avril Smith and vocalist and two-time IBMA Bass Player of the Year Vickie Vaughn. There has never been a band like Della Mae in roots music before, but thanks to Kimber Ludiker, Celia Woodsmith, Avril Smith, Vickie Vaughn - and all of the women who have been part of this band over its long life - we know there will be many more bands, singers, songwriters, and pickers just like Della Mae in the future.",

    "description": "ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY FUST Fust - the Durham, North Carolina-based band - announce their new album, Big Ugly, out March 7th via Dear Life Records. Big Ugly arrives after the release of 2024's Songs of the Rail--\"one of the best alt-country compilations.in a long, long time\" (Paste) -- and 2023's standout Genevieve, which unassumingly introduced new listeners to Fust's unmistakable blend of \"small-town poetry\" (Mojo) with a familiar yet probing \"country-tinged folk-rock\" (KEXP) that made it \"one of the most fun rock records of the year\" (Pitchfork).Big Ugly finds Fust taking its \"gutsy, blue-collar Americana\" (New Commute) further than it has before. Songwriter Aaron Dowdy pushes his obsessions with country-storytelling to more mystifying places, telling stories of Southern life teeming with utopian possibility that arises uniquely from the contradictions for which the south is infamously known. In this way, it is a record that could easily be filed on the record shelf alongside lyric-forward indie or Southern rock, as well as on the bookshelf amongst the throngs of Southern literature hellbent on proving the elegance of grittiness. Big Ugly is also Fust--above all a group of close friends--uncovering a freedom within their sincere form of loose and fried guitar rock, emboldened to deliver both their most intimate songwriting and biggest sound to date.While perhaps \"few voices can write a song quite like Aaron Dowdy\" (Paste), it is clear upon listening that Big Ugly is an album of fully recognizable voices. One hears in the music the years of interplay between Avery Sullivan (Sluice) on Drums, Justin Morris (Sluice, Weirs) on guitar and vocals, Oliver Child-Lanning (Sluice, Weirs) on bass and vocals, Frank Meadows on piano, John Wallace (Colamo) on guitar and vocals, and Libby Rodenbough (Mipso) on fiddle and vocals. Big Ugly is also the second collaboration with the Asheville-based engineer Alex Farrar, recorded together throughout the summer of 2024 at Drop of Sun Studio. And with the help of many friends including Merce Lemon, Dave Hartley (The War on Drugs), and John James Tourville (The Deslondes), Big Ugly is exactly what one feels it to be: a huge group of people gathered together, stumbling upon songs amidst long days and even longer nights. MERCE LEMON \"I could not be alive alone,\" a longtime family friend says with a smile. \"None of us could be alive alone.\" Within the quiet, cascading corners of Pittsburgh lies a community - nothing short of one large family - that spans zip codes, histories, occupations, and generations, always tumbling inwardly into itself, propped up by steadfast pillars of conviction toward spiritual and emotional mutual aid. The kind of earnest community scaffolding that gets bandied about, wielded as conjecture, particularly in an age of increasing fracture through digital sublimation, is alive and quite well within the universe surrounding Merce Lemon.

    "description": "ALL AGES FULLY SEATED SHOW LIMITED NUMBER OF PREMIUM SEATING TICKETS AVAILABLE CHRIS SMITHER The sound and imagery of the 20th release by Chris Smither, All About the Bones, (release date: May 3, 2024 on Signature Sounds/Mighty Albert, distributed by Redeye) is as elemental as the inky black shadows cast by a shockingly bright moon. The listener is welcomed into some gothic mansion on an imaginary New Orleans street, and there in the lamplit parlor confronts the band, a minimalist skeleton crew: Smither's inimitable propulsive guitar and rumbling baritone are joined seamlessly to producer David Goodrich's carpetbag of instruments, Zak Trojano's rock-steady, primal drumming, BettySoo's diaphanous harmony vocals, and the flat, mournful flood of Jazz legend Chris Cheek's saxophone. Recorded at Sonelab Studios in Easthampton MA by Justin Pizzoferrato (Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr., the Hold Steady) All About the Bones has a feel that is somehow baroque and austere at once. Smither and his longtime producer David Goodrich have been refining their musical conversation for decades, both in the studio and onstage, and by now, their bond verges on the telepathic. Goodrich plays on nearly every track. His sound is by now so translucent that it seems to function as a swath of silence, allowing the songs to burn like ciphers in the crackling air. And oh, the songs on All About the Bones. Chris Smither, after six decades of sharpening his knife as a songwriter, can at this point open damn near anything with a flick of his wrist. God and the Devil are opened here. Mortality is too. Politics, consciousness, renewal, family, vulnerability, surrender. Smither has sat with these topics like so many Zen koans, for so long, that every line is a pearl. The title track, \"All About the Bones,\" kicks the record off with \"Consider your high station/ think about your fame. All of your creation depended on your frame.\" Irony, wit, the double meaning of \"depended\". each verse is a master class in songwriting. Yet the stark, elemental sage always has a twinkle in his eye, a light touch at your elbow as he guides you along. From the wickedly funny defense of the Adversary in \"If Not for the Devil\" to the unsentimental open-heartedness of \"Still Believe in You,\" he is as human as we all long to be. The disjointed imagery of \"In the Bardo\" and the dystopian mirror of \"Close the Deal\" find Smither unflinchingly staring down the mortality of both individuals and republics, and yet he is at peace, among loved ones in his cover of Eliza Gilkyson's \"Calm Before the Storm,\" and turning his gaze to the future in \"Completion\". As noted by the New York Times, Rolling Stone, MOJO, NPR, and others, in the decades of travels to All About the Bones, Chris Smither has gone from up-and-comer to journeyman to veteran to icon, and yet the whole time his path has more closely resembled Joseph Campbell's \"Hero with a Thousand Faces\"- an unblinking, fearless trek into the depths of struggle and revelation, and a return back to the land of the living, to share the hard-won treasures found along the way. His restlessness is long gone, and his eyes are fixed \"where the moonlight falls on some never-to-be-seen horizon\" (\"Still Believe in You\"). The light given off from his music casts our own lives into a sublime and welcome clarity.",

In that time, the New York-based band has released a pair of well-received albums, an EP, and played countless shows. Prior to the pandemic, the band was really starting to hit its stride. They had a system in place and were spreading their brand of melodic rock to the masses. In fact, they could count Jack White, Arctic Monkeys, and Orville Peck as vocal supporters, which led to support slots for each. Soon, incredible live appearances at Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, Newport Folk Festival, and Shaky Knees became the norm. Over the course of the last two years, The Nude Party decided to produce their new album, Rides On, themselves. With the help of Matthew Horner, The Nude Party had as much fun creating as they ever had at any other point in their career. Their new album includes 14 songs that dabble in electro-pop and stripped-down country. The Nude Party coalesced and embraced the spirit of collaboration. They're excited to begin the next chapter of their career. At a time when it would have been easy to pack it in, the band continues to persevere. TOBACCO CITY Tobacco City is a Chicago-based band that blends cosmic country with a mix of psychedelic rock and honky-tonk soul. Their sound captures the essence of small-town nostalgia while embracing modern-day themes, exploring heartache, longing, and the bittersweet nature of life. With their uplifting energy and authentic songwriting, Tobacco City continues to carve out a unique space in the country-tinged Americana scene.",

    "description": "ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY DANCE WITH THE DEAD Drawing inspiration from the dystopian and chilling worlds of cult classic horror and science-fiction films, duo Justin Pointer and Tony Kim have spent over a decade crafting a signature fusion of dark electronic music and metal-fueled synth anthems. Hailing from Irvine, California (USA), DANCE WITH THE DEAD continue to push the boundaries of retro-futuristic soundscapes and cinematic storytelling. The project first emerged on Halloween night in 2013 with their debut release, setting the tone for a career defined by innovation and an ever-evolving sonic identity. Their early work-spanning atmospheric orchestral-leaning pieces and aggressive synth metal-solidified their presence with fan-favorite releases such as Into the Abyss (EP), Near Dark, and crossover hits like \"Andromeda\" and \"Invader.\" Their influence within the synthwave world earned them a featured appearance in the acclaimed documentary The Rise of the Synths, narrated by filmmaker John Carpenter. DANCE WITH THE DEAD's distinctive sound merges analog synth textures with the raw grit of early heavy metal guitars-a combination shaped by influences such as Hans Zimmer, Justice, Daft Punk, The Misfits, White Zombie, Ozzy Osbourne, Alice Cooper, Kavinsky, Metallica, and John Carpenter. Their catalog has featured notable collaborations as well, including guest contributions from John Carpenter and Cody Carpenter (Driven to Madness), as well as Nick Hipa and professional skateboarder Elliot Sloan (Loved to Death). MAGIC SWORD Magic Sword is an ageless tale of good and evil told through an ever expanding graphic novel with each volume accompanied by an original, synth-heavy soundtrack as well as immersive live performances. With the three mediums intertwined from conception, together they create an epic experience for those bold enough to bear witness and come away with a deeper understanding of the ultimate hero's journey. Armed with a musical and visual aesthetic that has its roots unabashedly buried deep in the golden era of '70s and '80s fantasy and sci-fi, Magic Sword's followers are called to another plane of existence where the struggle between light and shadow becomes all too real. The multiverse has aligned to bring the people of the land together for the birth of their album Endless, followed by a tour of the realm searching for the greater good.
