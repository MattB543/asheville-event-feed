Overall, the scoring logic is quite robust. The system does a great job of elevating touring acts at major venues (Orange Peel, Grey Eagle) and identifying high-concept local "gems" (Crankie Fest, ALT ASO).

However, looking at the top 50 events, there are **five major areas where I disagree with the scoring**, mostly due to inconsistencies in how "Magnitude" (scale/draw) and "Uniqueness" (Asheville-specific flavor) were applied.

### 1. The "Major Museum Exhibit" Underscore

**Events:** _Look Homeward, Angel_, _Women of the Pacific Northwest_, _Highwater_, and _Lasting Legacies_ (Asheville Art Museum).

- **Current Score:** 5/30 (Rarity: 1, Uniqueness: 2, Magnitude: 2)
- **My Disagreement:** Scoring these at a "5" (the same as a weekly $5 burger night at Burial) is a major miss. These are professionally curated, high-magnitude cultural events at a centerpiece downtown institution.
- **Proposed Correction:**
  - **Magnitude** should be at least **4 or 5** (Major institution).
  - **Uniqueness** for _Look Homeward, Angel_ (Thomas Wolfe) and _Lasting Legacies_ (Asheville Architecture) should be **8**, as they are specifically and exclusively about Asheville's identity.
  - **Total Score should be ~14-16/30**, placing them in the "solid local outing" category rather than "routine taproom special."

### 2. Magnitude Inflation for Small Workshops

**Events:** _Body Worship_ (Score 19, Magnitude 5), _Strength in Solidarity_ (Score 17, Magnitude 2), _The Compass Within_ (Score 23, Magnitude 5).

- **My Disagreement:** "Magnitude" represents the scale of the draw. _Body Worship_ is a trauma-informed class for a small group, yet it is given a Magnitude of **5** (the same as a Division I basketball game or a mid-sized concert). This inflates the score to 19, making it look like a major city event when it is a tiny, intimate cohort.
- **Proposed Correction:** Magnitude for these private studio workshops should be **1 or 2**. This would drop _Body Worship_ to a ~15/30, which is more appropriate for its actual reach.

### 3. "Killers of Kill Tony" vs. Local Authenticity

**Event:** _Killers of Kill Tony_ (Score 25/30).

- **My Disagreement:** This is the 4th highest-rated event in the city. While the **Magnitude (9)** is correct (Thomas Wolfe Auditorium), the **Uniqueness (8)** is far too high. This is a "cookie-cutter" national touring roadshow. It has zero "Asheville-weird" energy.
- **Proposed Correction:** Drop Uniqueness to **4**. This moves the total to **21/30**. It stays in the Top 50 because of its scale, but it shouldn't be ranked higher than the _Annual Gingerbread Display_ or _Crankie Fest_, which are the soul of the city.

### 4. The "Lexington Glassworks Seconds Sale" Underscore

**Event:** _Annual Seconds Sale - Lexington Glassworks_ (Score 20/30).

- **My Disagreement:** This event is scored a 20. In the context of Asheville, this is one of the most anticipated single-day events of the year. People camp out on the sidewalk for this.
- **Proposed Correction:**
  - **Rarity** is a **9** (It is literally once a year, one day only).
  - **Magnitude** should be a **6** (The block is usually packed).
  - **Total Score should be 23-24/30**, putting it on par with the Orange Peel headliners.

### 5. "Scrappin' With The Girls" Magnitude Error

**Event:** _Scrappin' With The Girls - 80s Scrapbooking Retreat_ (Score 20/30).

- **My Disagreement:** This is scored as a 20, largely due to a **Magnitude of 6**. This implies it has a larger public draw than a show at the Grey Eagle or a championship archery tournament. While it has 200 participants, it is a closed, sold-out retreat.
- **Proposed Correction:** Because the public cannot actually attend (it is sold out and a closed retreat), the **Magnitude** should be lower for a general event guide, or it should be flagged. Its high score suggests it’s a "Main Character" city event, but for 99% of people, it’s a private convention.

### Summary Table of Disagreements (Top 50)

| Event                       | Current Score | My Take | Reason                                                          |
| :-------------------------- | :-----------: | :-----: | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Killers of Kill Tony**    |      25       | **21**  | Too "Unique" (8). It's a standard touring show.                 |
| **The Compass Within**      |      23       | **18**  | Magnitude (5) is too high for a residential address.            |
| **Body Worship**            |      19       | **15**  | Magnitude (5) is too high for a small class.                    |
| **Thomas Dambo Trolls**     |      19       | **22**  | Rarity (5) is low. These are world-famous and a major "moment." |
| **Art Museum Exhibits**     |       5       | **15**  | Drastically underscored across the board.                       |
| **Glassworks Seconds Sale** |      20       | **24**  | Underscored rarity. It's a "cult" Asheville event.              |

**Final Verdict:** If you are looking for the _true_ Asheville experience, the **Crankie Fest (25)** and **ALT ASO (24)** are your best-scored winners. I would simply be wary of the "Workshop" and "Closed Retreat" scores that have crept into the Top 50 due to high Magnitude ratings.
