## New Year's Day Group Walk in Asheville with 7 KM and 10 KM Options

**Date:** Thursday, January 1, 2026 at 12:30 PM

**Location:** Asheville Area Chamber of Commerce, 36 Montford Ave, Asheville, NC (28806)

**Organizer:** Haywood County Walking Meetup Group

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP (ID: 312436827)

**Tags:** Outdoors, Fitness, Community, New Year's Day, 7 Km Option, 10 Km Option, Urban Trail Route, Hilly With Stairs

### Score

- **Total:** 12/30
- **Rarity:** 5/10
- **Uniqueness:** 4/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** Annual New Year’s Day community-led urban-trail walk — date-specific but recurring each year (seasonal), mildly Asheville-flavored so a bit unique, and a hyper-local walking-club event with modest draw.

**AI Summary:** Brisk urban walking routes along Asheville's Urban Trail with 7 km and 10 km options, mostly paved but including hills and stairs; dogs on leash welcome, and participants should bring water and a protein snack.

### Description

We are joining the Asheville Amblers Walking Club, Stryder, AARP, and perhaps some others, for this walk. Dress for the weather.

There are some hills and stairs, but this walk is nearly all on pavement. Tennis shoes are fine, but some may want walking sticks. This walk would not be good for wheelchairs and would be rather difficult for strollers. Dogs on leash would be ok.

As always, bring water and a protein snack.

Enjoy portions of the Urban Trail through the vibrant art deco downtown and the ambience of a designated "All American City". Visit the Grove Arcade with shops and restaurants to depict its original uniqueness as an indoor shopping mall back in the 1920s. Walk by the Thomas Wolfe Home, well known author of *Look Homeward, Angel* and *You Can't Go Home Again*. Visit several old neighborhoods of Asheville and the Greenway along Reed Creek. Meander through the historic Montford District with old homes and B&Bs. Ramble through Riverside Cemetery where O. Henry (author of "The Gift of the Magi") and Thomas Wolfe are buried.

We will register at 12:30 in the parking lot behind the Asheville Chamber of Commerce Visitors Center. The Visitors Center will be closed, so we suggest taking care of any personal needs just prior to arrival.

The walk is free, although donations to the Amblers would be accepted ($4 suggested). Step-off will be at 1:00. Choose between a 7 KM/4 mile and a 10 KM/6 mile version of the walk. The walk will be guided by experienced group walking leaders.

Since their formation in 2004, Phuncle Sam has been firmly rooted in musical exploration. The band serves up inventive interpretations of Jerry Garcia, Grateful Dead and many others. They have built up a faithful following by using an approach that respects the improvisational traditions of The Grateful Dead, while exploring what can happen when individual band members bring their unique influences and interpretations into the mix. Founded in 2005, Pisgah is known for producing some of the most sought after craft ales in Western North Carolina. Pisgah Brewing Company currently operates the new indoor taproom & deli, with live music several days a week, plus an open air outdoor bar in the summer and fall months.

We get some incredible musicians all together to have a really fun time! Sponsored by Alien Music Club https://www.facebook.com/AlienMusicClub. https://www.alienmusicclub.com/.

### Score

- **Total:** 12/30
- **Rarity:** 5/10
- **Uniqueness:** 4/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** Recurring weekly-style casual tennis meetups (hence moderate rarity).

### Description

We’re still working to get more people into these Meetups, but our goal is to give PlayYourCourt members a few social tennis outings each week in addition to your practice sessions and Challenge League matches.

These Meetups are co-ed, super laid back, and all skill levels are welcome. Post your skill level and a suggested court in the comments section so we can round up as many players as we can for some tennis fun!

Also, if you’re looking to meet new practice partners or play some matches and you aren’t already in the PlayYourCourt Community, you can go here to see what we’re all about and sign up:

https://www.playyourcourt.com/tennis-community/asheville-nc/meetup/

Happy hitting!

## AI for Human Flourishing - calling all builders & organizers

**Date:** Thursday, January 1, 2026 at 7:00 PM

**Location:** Switchyards, 217 Coxe Ave, Asheville, NC (28806)

**Organizer:** Asheville Friendly Ambitious Nerds

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP (ID: 312653820)

**Tags:** Tech, Networking, AI Builders, Creator Meetup, Small Group, Recurring Meetup, Switchyards Coworking

### Score

- **Total:** 10/30
- **Rarity:** 2/10
- **Uniqueness:** 6/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Recurring, peer-led small meetup (3–5 people) at Switchyards — niche AI builders/organizers gives it solid novelty but it’s hyper-local with low draw and easily missable.

**AI Summary:** Peer-led meetups for builders and organizers experimenting with AI tools, models, and creative workflows. Small 3–5 person sessions at Switchyards focused on project demos, prompt troubleshooting, and community collaboration.

### Description

**This is a recurring event for people who are building/creating/organizing around AI.**

(3 - 5 people usually attend, even if no one RSVPs on Meetup)

By "create stuff", I mean anything! Software, a book/blog, a game, art, whatever

By "using AI", I mean in any way! In the creation process or as a part of the product you're creating

Why? Because AI is getting very powerful, it's a meta-tool that changes and upgrades in interesting ways all the time. Let's help each other figure out how best to use it!

Also, because working on your projects in a group setting helps with your creativity, motivation, etc.

I'll be working on designing and prototyping AI tools that help people and institutions think more clearly, forecast better, and coordinate. Things like information parsing, decision support, fact-checking, negotiation aids, etc.

I aim to host the meetup at a co-working space I'm a member of. There will be limited seats, and you have to register for the event.

If you have any questions/ideas, let me know

- **Rarity:** 4/10
- **Uniqueness:** 4/10

**AI Summary:** Monthly guided sitting and Dharma discussion led by Buddhist teacher Ronya Banks, combining meditation instruction, group sharing, and practical Buddhist principles in a 90‑minute virtual community circle.

### Description

You do not have to walk this path alone. In fact, this journey is that much more rich and enjoyable when traversed with others.
Groups Openings

Led by Buddhist teacher Ronya Banks, this group meets once a month, for an hour and a half.

Group Meeting Includes:
Group Discussion and Sharing
Instruction on Dharma/Buddhist Principles
Guided Meditation
Meditation Instruction
Connecting with Other Practitioners
Most people on a spiritual journey find it supportive, often even necessary to get the regular support of a meditation teacher, as well as the mutuality and connection with other meditation practitioners on this path.

This monthly group affords you with the opportunity to connect with a teacher and other like-minded people, wherein you will all boldly delve deeply into different ways of approaching your formal and informal mindfulness practices through the lens of the Buddhist teachings.

Price: By Donation (According to your affordability and arranged with teacher)

### Score

- **Total:** 7/30
- **Rarity:** 2/10
- **Uniqueness:** 3/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Free, local group hike — scenic and pleasant but very common (many similar New Year hikes), low draw beyond nearby hikers, not a one-off or high-production event.

**AI Summary:** Spectacular 7.2-mile out-and-back stroll along Big Laurel Creek's rapids, pools, and gorges, mostly flat but stony underfoot, with a 15-minute break at the French Broad confluence; group meetup from Weaverville plaza.

### Description

**Sign-up opens Sunday, December 28th, at 8:00 PM.**

***HAPPY 2026!***

This out-and-back hike northwest of Asheville is a spectacular stroll along the picturesque Big Laurel Creek. You'll see many beautiful views of the creek's rapids, pools, and gorges along the way.

We'll take the trail all the way to its terminus at the confluence of Big Laurel Creek and the French Broad River. There, we'll pause for around a 15-minute break before heading back.

The trail is nearly flat, but rather stony and rooted in places. Hiking poles are advisable if you might feel unsteady. There are around a half-dozen trivial stream crossings, and there may be some muddy spots here and there along the route.

We'll do a steady 2.3-ish mph pace. I'd put the difficulty level at 3/10.

Well-behaved dogs are welcome on-leash. Wear sensible hiking boots. Bring some water and a snack or lunch if you'd like.

**CARPOOLING TIME & PLACE**

We'll carpool from the **Weaverville Publix Supermarket** and leave there at **9:30 AM** sharp, so *come a few minutes early*. It's at **165 Weaver Blvd.**, Weaverville. **Exit 19B from I-26.** We'll gather at the **west end of the lot**, which is to the left as you face the store. (Look for me and my silver Hyundai sedan.) It'll be a 25-minute drive to the trailhead. We'll be back at Publix by roughly 1:30 PM.

**[Weaverville Publix on Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/Dw3KEb5oZP2dSVBR7)**
https://goo.gl/maps/Dw3KEb5oZP2dSVBR7

If you plan to meet us at the trailhead, please post a comment or message me, and arrive by 10:00. The parking lot is at "Big Laurel Trailhead" on Rt. 25/70 just before it turns into Rt. 208.

### Description

From trailhed, Rainbow Rod to Old Mitchell Toll Rd. to Hickory Ridge Trail which will take us to Lookout Mtn and to E. Ridge trail. We'll come back via Eastridge Trail to Buck Gap and Old Trestle Trail. It's about 5.3 to 5.5 miles. 1100 feet elevation gain. It will probably take us a little over 2 hours. We don't typically stop except for a mid-point water break.

Meet at the Lookout parking lot/Trailhead in Montreat.

- **Reasoning:** Second-annual, once-a-year New Year’s vision-boarding (seasonal, missable but not one-off). Low-key craft/community wellness vibe with a magical musical taproom—distinctly Asheville (+2 to Unique). Small local venue/low-ticket draw, so modest magnitude.

**AI Summary:** Low-key, magical evening of vision boarding in The Well's musical taproom, crafting collages to call in dreams and intentions for 2026; bring magazines and trinkets or use provided supplies while socializing or quietly creating.

### Description

This is our 2nd Annual New Year’s Vision Boarding Session! This vision boarding session is low-key—chilling and hanging out in the magical, musical atmosphere of The Well, and calling in our dreams and intentions for 2026. Bring: something to craft your vision board on, scissors, magazines, doodads, shiny bits, scraps of lace, old pictures, lucky charms, glue sticks, and snacks—or just show up because we’ll have stuff like that there for you already.

We can be chatty and interactive or leave you to be hyper-focused in your zone while surrounded by other creatives. Stay the whole time or drop in and out.

Suggested donation $5-$25 (NOTAFLOF) Donations go entirely to keeping The Well open to our beloved community.

### Score

- **Total:** 5/30
- **Rarity:** 1/10
- **Uniqueness:** 2/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Weekly recurring event - happens every week.

**AI Summary:** Guided connection practice using timed listening exercises and facilitated sharing circles to cultivate genuine interpersonal connection without advice. Participants rotate facilitator and Space Owl roles in a small healing center setting.

### Description

A Connection Practice is a meeting to practice your skills in listening and connecting with others. No conversation topic is off limits. The only objective of the meeting is to feel a genuine sense of connection by the time it's over, and the only rule is that we promise to not give each other advice.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates.

**AI Summary:** Quiet, color saturated paintings and mixed media exploring tranquil moments by four local artists, Robin Dail, Lindsay Keeling, Susan B. Viemeister, and Cindy Wheeler; evening opening reception encourages slow viewing and socializing.

### Score

- **Total:** 16/30
- **Rarity:** 6/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 5/10
- **Reasoning:** A limited-run gallery opening at an intimate Patton Avenue space — missable but not one-off; a calm, color-focused exhibit offers a pleasant, somewhat distinctive experience but is a local/museum-scale draw rather than a major headliner.

**AI Summary:** Serene, color-focused artworks transform an intimate Patton Avenue gallery into a contemplative evening viewing with soft lighting, calming palettes, and immersive visual study ideal for reflective audiences.

## Fairlight and the Magick

**Date:** Friday, January 2, 2026 at 6:00 PM

**Location:** Highland Brewing Company, 12 Old Charlotte Hwy, Ste 200, Asheville, NC (28803)

**Organizer:** Highland Brewing Company

**Price:** Unknown

**Source:** AVL_TODAY (ID: 17698863)

**Tags:** Live Music, Beer, Soulful Vocals, Folk Rock, Brewery Taproom

### Score

- **Total:** 11/30
- **Rarity:** 2/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 4/10
- **Reasoning:** A typical Friday brewery taproom gig — solid local folk/roots entertainment at Highland Brewing. Good local draw but a common recurring-style show with many similar brewery nights, so not rare or hugely novel.

**AI Summary:** Powerful soulful vocals propel Fairlight and the Magick's folk rock set, blending Appalachian tinged melodies with tight ensemble interplay. The band plays Highland Brewing's taproom for a rootsy, lively brewery night.

### Description

The origin story of Fairlight and the Magick is pretty mundane and hardly uncommon. The band came together through connections made though informal jams, broken-up bands and a Craigslist ad.  The pieces started coming together in the aftermath of Helene.  The members of the band came from all directions; Chicago, Florida, Colorado and Charlotte to make Western North Carolina their home.   Once the band members were all in the same room, the power and soulfulness of Fairlight’s voice was astonishing. The mission of the band was clear; to develop and sound and style to fit Fairlight’s amazing talent. The first thing that became apparent was the rhythm section of Jeff Rubin on drums and Walter Anderson on bass brings a high level of skill, feeling and groove to whatever they play. Whether the song is a slow blues, driving rock, funky or soulful—there is always a deep pocket there. David Harris on guitar brings a gritty, driven, psychedelic blues sound to the band, but also plays with a sense of melody when the song calls for it.   As a band, Fairlight and the Magick plays with tons of feeling and soul!

## Sensory Immersion Night  with Senseful Wellness

**Date:** Friday, January 2, 2026 at 6:00 PM

**Location:** Energetic Experiences, 81 Weaverville Rd Suite 2, Asheville, NC (28804)

**Organizer:** Awakening Asheville

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP (ID: 312451054)

**Tags:** Wellness, Meditation, Sensory Immersion, Somatic Exploration, Trauma Informed, Nervous System Regulation, Gentle Guided Practice

### Score

- **Total:** 16/30
- **Rarity:** 5/10
- **Uniqueness:** 7/10
- **Magnitude:** 4/10
- **Reasoning:** A recurring small-studio wellness session (not a one-off) so moderately missable; trauma-informed sensory/somatic work has high 'main-character' vibe and earns an Asheville-weird boost; community-scale local venue = modest regional draw.

**AI Summary:** Slow, guided sensory immersion practices using tactile, auditory, and proprioceptive techniques to rewire habitual stress responses and restore nervous-system regulation. Trauma-informed somatic exploration emphasizes grounding, body awareness, and gentle movement.

### Description

**Sensory Immersion Night**
Have you explored sensory Exploration for your nervous system?
Our senses have a beautiful way of grounding us into the present moment but this can take some work. Our sensory world can also become disconnected when our nervous system has stayed in pattern loops from high levels of stress and/or trauma.

This is essentially a disconnect of mind and body. The sensory information we receive from the outside world, drives movement patterns in the body. So, if we’re constantly perceiving the world as unsafe, we will move in that way.

**How do we begin to correct this?**
We start the practice of reintegrating the senses. Meditating can be challenging when we’ve been in a heightened state, so exploring adding additional sensory input can help to get you out of attachment to your busy racing thoughts and into the feelings/sensations created in your body. The more you explore the five traditional senses more mindfully, the more you can perceive energy. The more energy you perceive, the more you feel connected to everything. Learning to express and move energy is vulnerable, but as the research shows, vulnerability is the key to personal freedom.

This evening will be all about tuning in and listening to your needs. This is a neurodivergent friendly space that honors consent and personal preferences.

**What to expect:**
mindful sensory exploration
stations to explore various sensory techniques
group meditation with added sensory input
Donation only/pay what you can

**Senseful Wellness & Yoga** is a Queer owned company created in 2020 as a way to expand the concept of healing beyond the borders of the established systems and boxes of the healthcare world. Creating workshops, guiding group retreats, and sharing virtual content became a way of teaching and sharing the many layers to mind, body, spirit healing.

**Organizer:** Asheville Cuddle Collective

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP (ID: 312593546)

**Tags:** Wellness, Community, Platonic Touch, Consent Focused, Non Sexual, Ticketed Registration, Guided Touch Exercises

### Score

- **Total:** 14/30
- **Rarity:** 4/10
- **Uniqueness:** 8/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** A fairly common type of wellness/community meetup (not highly rare), but it has strong Asheville ‘weird’/consent-focused vibes and guided platonic cuddling (unique + Asheville bonus), and is a small, hyper-local group event with limited draw.

**AI Summary:** Gentle, consent-centered group cuddling with guided touch exercises to explore platonic intimacy in a boundary-respecting, non-sexual setting; paid tickets required to reserve space for a beginner-friendly, community-focused practice.

### Description

Please note- If you want to attend this event you need to purchase a ticket- We advertise in many places and only paid tickets will reserve your space.[ ](https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/jan-2nd-community-cuddles)**[Click HERE to register!](https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/jan-2nd-community-cuddles)**

**This is a non-sexual touch based event that invites participants to explore platonic intimacy in a safe environment** with like-minded people. We respect personal boundaries and through a supportive framework of mutual agreements that maximize safety and create a space of easy openness and compassionate connection.
At this event we have the chance to normalize touch with clear boundaries; this is a space for respectful, consent-based touch. We allow ourselves to be seen. We have fun.
We welcome people of all backgrounds, genders, ethnicities, relationship styles, sexualities, sizes, and ages (18+).

**THE RULES**
1\. Clothes stay on for the whole event\.
2\. You do not have to touch anyone at this event\.
3\. You must receive a verbal YES before you touch anyone\.
4\. Take care of yourself and those you choose to interact with\.
5\. Speak up if you have a question\, concern\, or if you need assistance with anything during the event\.
6\. All emotions are welcome\- we love vulnerability\.
**WHY CUDDLE?**
Touch is a basic human need, and many of us do not get enough; most people don’t even know they are missing touch, or have a way to ask for touch without sexualizing it. We believe deeply in the power of touch, and the importance of communication and consent in creating a safe space for touch.
CUDDLING WITH STRANGERS
Cuddling with strangers sounds weird or scary to most people. “Will I like it?” “What if someone wants to touch me and I don’t want to?” “What if I say yes and it’s not what I want?” “What if I really want to touch someone and they say no?” These are all normal questions. The answer is that this is a space created to ask for exactly what you w...

Intention:
Breath and Bone is an ecstatic dance journey rooted in the body’s oldest knowing. This dance invites the shedding of unnecessary stories that can separate us from our deepest truths and brings to life the most primal and honest parts of the body. Together, we will drop into the exploration of our wildest parts through movement driven by ancient rhythms.

DJ Yaku Beat channels the spirit of water - flowing, cleansing and alive. From a life in modern medicine and entrepreneurship to years on the sacred plant medicine path, Josh's evolution has spanned many worlds. Guided by an appetite for self-revelation, his beats and live instrumentation will invite you into the depths of your most wild and luminous heart.

### Score

- **Total:** 16/30
- **Rarity:** 6/10
- **Uniqueness:** 7/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** One-night pop-up art market at a small vintage shop — reasonably missable but special (one-off date). Funky format and artists-keep-100% policy give it notable 'Asheville weird' charm (+2 to Unique). Small storefront venue and local roster keep the magnitude low (small, community draw).

**AI Summary:** Funky vintage shop transforms into a night market of accessible artworks by twelve WNC artists, with background music, beverages, and shopping (storewide 15% off); free entry and artists keep 100% of sales.

### Description

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MOUNTAIN_X (ID: mx-1015341)

**Tags:** Live Music, Beer, Appalachian Folk, Solo Singer Songwriter, Acoustic Storytelling, Taproom Show

### Score

- **Total:** 12/30
- **Rarity:** 3/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 4/10
- **Reasoning:** A one-night taproom folk set — intimate and charming but very typical of Asheville brewery shows. Free, local singer‑songwriter at One World Brewing makes it accessible but not rare or a large draw; solid for fans of Appalachian acoustic storytelling.

**AI Summary:** Warm Appalachian folk songs delivered by a river-boy turned mountain-man singer-songwriter, evoking campfire nights where the fire burns all night and laughter erupts; intimate acoustic set in a taproom.

### Description

Somewhere between the outdoors and the stage, there’s a place so familiar and much like home. My heart lives there. And my music is from that same place. The one where the fire burns all night and the smiles and laughter just seems to erupt from. The walk we all share, regardless of our differences, is my inspiration. Myself, I’m a river boy and a mountain man of the Appalachian. I am a native of Catawba County. I look forward to bringing a little peace from my neck of the woods up the mountain to share with all you lovely folks. My influences range modern to classic with a BIG touch of soul woven into the mix. I look forward to sharing a night of local brews and tunes with all you sweet souls.

### Score

- **Total:** 18/30

- **Uniqueness:** 9/10
- **Magnitude:** 4/10
- **Reasoning:** High-concept, very Asheville-friendly analog synth + quadraphonic sound bath (Asheville-weird bonus boosts uniqueness), but sound baths are common locally and this is at a small wellness venue so modest rarity and local-scale draw.

**AI Summary:** Quadraphonic washes of analog synthesizers and resonant crystal singing bowls, bells, and gongs create an immersive meditative sound bath. Composer and sound designer Logos (James Genaro) sculpts textured, healing frequencies for deep relaxation.

### Description

Composer and sound designer Logos, aka James Genaro, will take you on a meditative musical experience, blending analog synthesizers and acoustic instruments (crystal singing bowls, bells, gongs and more) in a quadraphonic speaker array.

- **Total:** 21/30
- **Rarity:** 8/10
- **Uniqueness:** 6/10
- **Magnitude:** 7/10
- **Reasoning:** Single-night touring jamgrass show at The Grey Eagle — a true one-off local stop (hard to catch), solidly cool for jam/bluegrass fans but not wildly novel, and a regional-draw gig at a major Asheville venue.

**AI Summary:** Mandolin driven jamgrass blending original songwriting with traditional bluegrass, powered by dobro, pedal steel, guitar and rotating bassists in a high energy standing room club set for all ages.

### Score

- **Total:** 17/30
- **Rarity:** 7/10
- **Uniqueness:** 6/10
- **Magnitude:** 4/10
- **Reasoning:** One-off Simon & Garfunkel tribute by seasoned local pros in an intimate White Horse listening-room — nostalgically distinctive but small-scale local draw.

**AI Summary:** Lush acoustic folk rock arrangements and close vocal harmonies reimagine classic Simon and Garfunkel songs, with three seasoned singer musicians delivering stripped down, emotive renditions in an intimate listening room setting.

### Description

Take a trip back in time with composer, musician, band leader, singer and producer, Jonathan Pearlman (My Magnificent Nemesis, Alien Music Club), Blues Chanteuse Peggy Ratusz (Daddy LongLegs Blues Band, Love is a Rose Celebration of Linda Ronstadt, Love Bubble) and multi-instrumentalist, James Kylen (My Magnificent Nemesis, Here Comes the Sun: A celebration of the Beatles) as they celebrate the enduring magic of Simon & Garfunkel. At White Horse Black Mountain, we believe music is meant to be shared by all. Some households may only be able to give a little, while others may be able to give more to pay it forward and support neighbors. Each event includes a “suggested price” that reflects the normal cost of the show, but no matter what you contribute, you’re helping keep the music alive for our whole community.

### Score

- **Total:** 9/30
- **Rarity:** 2/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** A recurring weekly, free acoustic set at a neighborhood spot — very missable (low rarity). Trained solo guitarist with theatrical songcraft offers solid live-music appeal (moderate uniqueness). Held at The Whale Outpost, a small local venue, so hyper-local draw (low magnitude).

- **Reasoning:** A one-night gig by a regional roots band at an intimate local spot — more special than a weekly jam (missable) and fun/danceable, but not a major touring draw or highly novel Asheville spectacle.

**AI Summary:** Classic American roots music with danceable grooves and tight harmonies, blending mountain fiddles, guitars, and soulful vocals into upbeat, deeply resonant songs that spark foot stomping and singalong energy.

### Description

Lazybirds is a classic American roots band from the mountains of North Carolina. Specializing in good time music that is just about impossible not to move to, there is also a depth to the band that faithful fans have treasured over the years.

### Score

- **Total:** 12/30
- **Rarity:** 2/10
- **Uniqueness:** 6/10
- **Magnitude:** 4/10
- **Reasoning:** Local Hammond-organ jazz trio in The Palm Room at Fitz & the Wolfe — a recurring, late-night speakeasy gig with strong vibe but limited rarity and a small-venue draw.

**AI Summary:** Tight organ trio jazz anchored by Josh Blake's Hammond grooves in a low lit Palm Room speakeasy, delivering straight ahead improvisation, deep pocketed grooves, and late night cocktail friendly ambiance.

### Description

TeaPot Trio hits the Palm Room with a straight-ahead organ trio led by local musician Josh Blake. No gimmicks. Just tight jazz, deep grooves, and plenty of room to stretch out. The Palm Room stays low-lit and locked in, the band stays loose, and the night goes exactly where it’s supposed to. Settle in, grab a drink, and let the music handle the rest. Fitz, she’s the party. Wolfe, he’s the epicure. 2 levels, 3 vibes. 🎶 Live Music |🍸Sips & Noms 🥪 | 🕹️ Artcade | 🗝️Speakeasy | Private Events Fitz and the Wolfe is a cocktail and music venue shaped by the spirit of improvisation, storytelling, and the kind of nights that feel too good to end. Here, every night brings a new soundtrack. Jazz, swing, honky-tonk, and sometimes things a little more esoteric—if it moves people, we book it. The music fills the space like a second heartbeat, sometimes rowdy, sometimes intimate, always memorable. It’s not background noise. It’s the reason you’re here. fitzandthewolfe.com

Greetings everyone! Let’s get together and craft while snacking on pie! You can bring whatever craft you’re into, though please don’t bring anything too big/messy (e.g. no mural painting) since we want everyone to have space to work and need to leave the place spotless!

The Baked Pie Company has an ever rotating selection of award-winning pies (as well as quiche and salad); they even have pie flights! They also feature sugar free, gluten free, keto and vegan pies for those with dietary needs. So let's grab a slice of pie and build some community!

Don't worry if you can't make this one, though! It’s a monthly event; you'll have plenty of chances to get your pie on :)

## Walk Biltmore Estate's Deer Park Trail on National Chocolate Covered Cherry Day

**Date:** Saturday, January 3, 2026 at 12:00 PM

**Location:** Biltmore, 1 Lodge St, Asheville, NC (28806)

**Organizer:** Haywood County Walking Meetup Group

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP (ID: 312545317)

### Score

- **Total:** 11/30
- **Rarity:** 3/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** A regular Meetup-led nature walk (low missability) but on the scenic Biltmore Deer Park Trail — modest, hyper-local draw; the Biltmore setting raises the uniqueness slightly while scale remains small.

**AI Summary:** Leisurely nature walk along the Deer Park Trail through mixed hardwoods to the Garden Trail junction, moderate footing and pace; organizer monitors Meetup comments and messages to help with parking and navigation.

### Description

Travel past the Biltmore House toward Antler Hill Village. Park in the first available area just past the Lagoon. We will access the Deer Park Trail from there. (I will be monitoring the Comments section of this walk page and also Meetup messages. If you get confused or lost, contact me right away.)

Deer Park Trail goes through the Deer Park (though it isn't near Lioncrest and the other DeerPark facilities). It comes to a T intersection. We will go right to where you can access the Garden Trails. Then we will turn around and go up the hill to the South Terrace of the Biltmore House. From there we will retrace our steps to the start point. It is about 2.5 miles round trip, or so says the map.

I've done this walk in both tennis shoes and in light hiking boots (from a different start point). I'll probably bring walking poles for the hill, though most of the walk won't need them.

Bring plenty of water and a protein snack. Dress for the weather; consider a hat and sunscreen. Dogs are welcome. Trail strollers would probably work.

PS: It being National Chocolate Covered Cherry Day, we just might enjoy a box of cherries at the end of the walk!!

## Dry January Nonalcoholic Bottle Shop Guided Tasting Event

**Date:** Saturday, January 3, 2026 at 1:00 PM

**Location:** NØLO - Non Alcoholic Bottle Shop, 178 Broadway Street, Asheville, NC (28801)

**Organizer:** NØLO - Booze-free Beverage Shop

**Price:** Free

**Source:** EVENTBRITE (ID: 1979074105926)

**Tags:** Wine & Spirits, Education, Nonalcoholic Drinks, Guided Tasting, Sober Curious, Bottle Shop

### Score

- **Total:** 15/30
- **Rarity:** 5/10
- **Uniqueness:** 8/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Part of a Dry January tasting series (multiple dates listed) so not rare but timely — score raised to a mid rarity to avoid crushing other dimensions. Very niche, sober-curious guided tasting with botanical/zero-proof focus and strong local 'Asheville' vibe (+2 unique bonus). Intimate bottle-shop setting is small-scale and hyper-local, so low magnitude.

**AI Summary:** Zero proof tasting flights of nonalcoholic wines, botanical sodas, and mocktails guided by knowledgeable staff in an intimate bottle shop setting, ideal for sober curious guests exploring flavor profiles and pairings.

### Description

Celebrate Dry January! Join us for a sampling event at NØLO - taste the best non-alcoholic drinks around and discover your new favorites!

Ground your body, clear your mind, and create a vision that inspires your year ahead!

Step into the new year with clarity, creativity, and intention. Join Allison and Stacy for a three-hour workshop designed to help you ground, reflect, and dream big.

We’ll begin with a gentle yoga flow, pranayama, and meditation to quiet the mind and open the heart. From that centered space, you’ll move into guided journaling to reflect on the past year and set meaningful intentions for the year ahead. With your vision clear, you’ll then create a personalized vision board—an inspiring visual reminder of the goals, dreams, and energy you want to call into your life. We’ll close with the deep rest of yoga nidra, sealing in your intentions with ease and calm.

All supplies for your vision board will be provided, along with light snacks. Just bring yourself, your curiosity, and a willingness to imagine what’s possible.
Start your year feeling grounded, inspired, and empowered with a vision you can carry into 2026 and beyond.

### Description

- **Uniqueness:** 2/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Weekly recurring event - happens every week.

**AI Summary:** Immersive crystal gong bath led by master gong player David Heiss, blending deep resonant gongs and sound healing to reset the nervous system; session opens with a brief astrology overview for energetic clearing and relaxation.

### Description

Join us for a relaxing sound bath meditation led by David Heiss, Master gong player and sound healing musician. David has been playing gongs and facilitating sound healing journeys since 2012. You can learn more about his work at [​https://starsounds.love](https://www.starsounds.love/)

Leave the week's stress behind as you relax and reset your nervous system with this special clearing crystal gong bath.

We will begin with a brief overview of the current astrology aspects in our sky. Then enjoy a powerful yet relaxing 45 min. gong meditation followed by an integration.

When the gong sings, you listen. You listen listens with every cell of your body. You hear it and feel it. You begin to sense more. The obscure sounds leave your brain guessing and eventually surrenders to the soundwave as you begin to relax, feel and heal. The vibrational frequencies can awaken stagnant energy. The experience is like a personal dream. There are moments during a gong meditation where the subconscious can become more conscious, where illumination and insight follows.

Suggested donations for this event are $20-40. Donations can be made at the event via cash or Venmo.

Please bring any comfort items you may desire: blankets, pillows, bolsters, eye mask, etc. We do not yet have enough community items for everyone.

* The event is from 4:30 - 6 p.m.

## New Year Full Wolf Moon Blacklight Yoga w/ Kasia Kane

**Date:** Saturday, January 3, 2026 at 6:00 PM

**Location:** Asheville Community Yoga, 8 Brookdale Rd,, Asheville, NC (28804)

### Score

- **Total:** 17/30
- **Rarity:** 6/10
- **Uniqueness:** 8/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** Single-date New Year/Full Wolf Moon event makes it more missable than a weekly class (rarity 6). Blacklight restorative yoga + full-moon ritual has strong local ‘Asheville weird’ main-character energy (high-concept; +Asheville bonus) so unique is high (8). Held at a small community yoga studio with a local audience and $20 ticket — modest regional draw (magnitude 3).

**AI Summary:** Neon-lit restorative yoga under blacklights aligned with the Full Wolf Moon for reflective release and New Year intention setting, blending breathwork and gentle movement in a community studio to culminate 2025 and plant intentions.

### Description

**For many, the start of a New Year brings reset, resolutions, and a chance to find what truly serves you. The full moon has similar beliefs in astrology, where it is said to represent culmination, completion, and release.  This Blacklight Yoga class will be a space to reflect and release 2025, and sow the seeds of your New Year’s intentions.**

**Through this lens, we can find deeper connection inside, and allow that to transfer to our interactions with others. Let this space to be an intentional container to reflect to one another and finally accept, understand, release attachments we have held onto.** 

**This will be a dynamic yoga flow, catered to all levels! Yogi’s discretion to take what you like and leave what does not serve, set to *melodic house music* to guide the flow. This class will have a dance session before flowing on the mat, as well as a dance fueled closing session before proceeding back to the floor for some winding down and ease into the rest of your evening.**

***Blacklight yoga is intended to be a playful and joyful space, fueled by the glowing lights, your energy, and your bright, colorful clothing!*** 

**Grab your neon, your New Year’s intentions, and come boogie with us!**

**Organizer:** CE5 Asheville

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP (ID: 312613808)

**Tags:** Spiritual, Meditation, Ce5 Protocols, Ufology Meetup, Alien Contact, Guided Group, Indoor Circle

### Score

- **Total:** 15/30
- **Rarity:** 4/10
- **Uniqueness:** 9/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** A seasonal/likely recurring local CE5 meetup — very niche ufology/meditation content with strong “Asheville weird” appeal (+2 to Unique), but small, community-led indoor gathering with limited regional draw.

**AI Summary:** Indoor winterized CE5 gathering focused on raising collective vibration and practicing established CE5 contact protocols to strengthen connection with extraterrestrial intelligences; includes guided intention meditations, group exercises, and shared encounter reports.

### Description

We are having our "winterized" CE5 event this Saturday which will take place indoors and will focus on ways of raising our vibration for improved connection with our ET friends. We will also be doing the CE5 protocols as we always do. Never underestimate what can happen indoors at a CE5 event!! This we’ve learned from experience.

If you are new to CE5 I invite you to go to the *blog* page on our website and read reports about things that have happened at our CE5 events. They’re all there at [CE5Asheville.com/blog](CE5Asheville.com/blog).

RSVP now and include any guests you would like to bring along. There are hotels within 5 minutes of the site in case you are coming from afar and want to stay the night.

People can start arriving between 6:30pm and 7:00. 7:00 to 7:30 will be a time of meet and greet.

At 7:30 we will begin working with some HRV coherence training. Which will be very similar to meditation only incorporating some HRV related hardware and software.

I will be sending more detailed followup information to you (including exact location of the site) once you have RSVPed YES .
So be expecting a followup message via the Meetup messages feature and read it all very carefully. IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure you are able to access the Meetup Messages feature. It is found at the top right of the Meetup webpage. Also note the Meetup App doesn't appear to be working properly. So don't rely on that for now. You'll have to go to your computer. If you don't find a followup message within 2 days of RSVPing message me directly or email me at [info@ce5asheville.com](info@ce5asheville.com)

If you have any pressing questions feel free to contact me. Looking to learn more about CE5 in general? Go to [CE5Asheville.com/learn](CE5Asheville.com/learn) to get pointed in the right direction.

## Surreal Sirkus Salon

**Date:** Saturday, January 3, 2026 at 7:00 PM

**Location:** The Well: A Gathering Place (3 Louisiana Avenue, Asheville, NC) (28806)

**Organizer:** The Surreal Sirkus

**Price:** Unknown

**Source:** FACEBOOK (ID: 2395647104227934)

**Tags:** Art, Community, Surrealism, Salon Style, Potluck, Intimate Gathering

**Engagement:** 83 interested, 19 going

### Score

- **Total:** 18/30
- **Rarity:** 7/10
- **Uniqueness:** 9/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** One-off/seasonal New‑Year salon feel (somewhat missable) hosted in a small community space; highly conceptual, participatory surrealism gives strong 'Asheville weird' main‑character energy (+bonus), but draws only a hyper‑local/intimate crowd.

**AI Summary:** Intimate salon evoking Breton era surrealism with communal potluck, low key theatrics, and participatory brainstorming that blends performance and visual art for collaborative ideation and small group creative exchange.

### Description

With the new year upon us, it is time for the Surreal Sirkus to return to our roots: indeed to the roots of surrealism itself. 

While the spectacle and theatrics of the big productions is how we draw the audience into our world, it is in the small interactions between ourselves that that world is created: the brainstorming sessions, the potluck... the salon. 

This was true for the OG surrealists, who would gather at the apartment of André and Simone Breton in Paris in the 1920s to discuss art, philosophy, and politics, share creative ideas, and play surrealist games — exercises in creating art by accessing the unconscious mind. 

Surreal Sirkus invites you to come take part in a similar salon, as we start to dream the next chapters of our collective story. 

If you feel so called, bring a song or a story or a poem or performance to share. At the very least be prepared to participate in some games. And of course, bring your imagination!

And bring a beverage or snack to share. 

Donations are not required, but are welcome to help support the space.

### Score

- **Total:** 15/30
- **Rarity:** 4/10
- **Uniqueness:** 6/10
- **Magnitude:** 5/10
- **Reasoning:** Free Saturday taproom gig at One World Brewing — high-energy local jamgrass/bluegrass fusion with soulful vocals and strong musicianship. Great local night out but similar taproom/residency shows are common, so moderately missable and a solid local draw rather than a regional headliner.

### Score

- **Total:** 14/30
- **Rarity:** 4/10
- **Uniqueness:** 7/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** Monthly retro vinyl DJ night at Urban Orchard — the vinyl-only, 70s–90s dance vibe gives a fun, niche twist (feels very Asheville), but it’s a recurring, small taproom event with limited regional draw.

**AI Summary:** Turntables spin warm vinyl disco, new wave, and 90s alt pop floor fillers in a cozy cider taproom; free entry and validated parking with purchase make retro dancing easy.

## ROCK N ROLL HANGOVER ft The New Variants, Jesse Velvet, Andrew Thelston Band at The Grey Eagle

**Date:** Saturday, January 3, 2026 at 8:00 PM

**Location:** The Grey Eagle, 185 Clingman Ave, Asheville, NC (28801)

**Organizer:** The Grey Eagle

**Price:** Ticketed

**Source:** AVL_TODAY (ID: 17698791)

**Tags:** Live Music, Family, Classic Hard Rock, Psychedelic Funk, Dual Percussion, Standing Room

### Score

- **Total:** 18/30
- **Rarity:** 6/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 7/10
- **Reasoning:** Single, ticketed one-off at The Grey Eagle (special but not ultra-rare) — solid classic-rock/funk bill with energetic staging but not highly novel. Regional draw at a major Asheville venue gives it mid-high magnitude.

**AI Summary:** Hard hitting classic rock covers of Zeppelin and AC/DC alongside Jesse Velvet’s funk and psychedelic grooves with blazing guitar solos, slick keys, deep pocket bass and dual percussion in an all ages standing room show.

### Description

ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY THE NEW VARIANTS The New Variants play your hard rock favorites: Zep, AC/DC, ZZ Top, VH, Skynyrd and Sabbath. We're rock and roll veterans assembled from regional groups over the last 20 years. A good time is guaranteed. JESSE VELVET Jesse Velvet crafts a dynamic fusion of funk, rock, and psychedelic exploration, powered by blazing guitar solos, slick keyboard work, deep-pocket bass lines, and an infectious dual-percussion groove. This Asheville-based sextet unites veteran players from Pyletribe, Scratchdog Stringband, Get Right Band and Pronounced Heroes, delivering original compositions that range from soul-drenched gritty funk and feel-good grooves to face-melting rock anthems. While rooted in tight songcraft, Jesse Velvet isn't afraid to stretch out into uncharted territory, with instrumental journeys that showcase the band's growing appetite for psychedelic exploration. Their recent single "Jeans" perfectly captures their essence - soulful vocals and playful lyrics wrapped in a serious musical punch. With the addition of percussion expanding their sound, the band continues to evolve, bringing new rhythmic dimensions to keep the dance floor moving. Currently, Jesse Velvet is preparing to release their first live album in early 2026, capturing the raw energy and musical interplay that's making them a standout in the WNC music scene. Whether laying down hard-hitting rock grooves or diving into improvisational passages, Jesse Velvet delivers a fresh sound that's both adventurous and accessible. ANDREW THELSTON BAND The Andrew Thelston Band, voted #1 favorite rock band in the 2023 Best of WNC contest by Mountain Xpress, has been stunning audiences in the WNC region (and beyond) for 5 years. Frontman Thelston, voted #1 best guitarist in the same competition, is the creative force, bringing high-energy, funk-infused original rock n' roll that draws influence from Prince, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Led Zeppelin, and Queen. In 2019, Thelston's ori...

### Score

- **Total:** 16/30
- **Rarity:** 7/10
- **Uniqueness:** 6/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** Single-night Slipknot tribute at Eulogy — missable one-off show with high-energy masks/mosh-pit theatrics (moderately unique), but a small club/local draw rather than a regional/national headliner.

**AI Summary:** High-energy nu metal tribute recreating Slipknot's mask clad aggression with crushing guitars, driving percussion, and thunderous low end; expect intense crowd interaction and a mosh pit ready, club-stage atmosphere.

### Score

- **Total:** 16/30
- **Rarity:** 6/10
- **Uniqueness:** 7/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** One-night, high-energy Slipknot tribute—missable but special; strong main-character vibe with masks/costumes and mosh-friendly chaos (nice niche draw), yet happening in a small bar (Eulogy) rather than a regional headliner.

**AI Summary:** Nine masked musicians recreate gut-punching percussion, downtuned guitars, and screamed vocals in a high-intensity, immersive Slipknot tribute evoking 2000s-era nu-metal chaos — a mosh-friendly late-night bar show.

### Description

Knot Your Kind is a full-scale, high-intensity Slipknot tribute band based out of Raleigh, North Carolina, built by nine dedicated musicians who don’t just play the songs—they live them. Born from a shared obsession with the chaos, emotion, and adrenaline of Slipknot’s music, the band formed in 2024 with one mission: deliver a tribute show so authentic, so precise, and so immersive that fans feel like they’ve been dropped straight into a 2000s-era Slipknot concert.

**Price:** $17.5

**Source:** MOUNTAIN_X (ID: mx-1005205)

**Tags:** Old Time, String Band, Appalachian Roots, Dance Friendly

### Score

- **Total:** 17/30
- **Rarity:** 6/10
- **Uniqueness:** 7/10
- **Magnitude:** 4/10
- **Reasoning:** Single-date grassroots old‑time string‑band show in Brevard — not a recurring weekly but not a once‑in‑a-lifetime stop (Rarity 6). Strong Appalachian authenticity and dance‑friendly sets give it notable local “Asheville” character (+Unique 7). Small/regional venue and local draw rather than a major touring headliner, so Magnitude is modest (4).

**AI Summary:** Grassroots old‑time string-band music driven by clawhammer banjo, fiddle, and acoustic guitar, blending Appalachian reels and close harmonies; energetic, dance-friendly sets shaped by Western North Carolina tradition and local collaborations.

### Description

Pretty Little Goat is grassroots music at its finest. The band formed in 2013 through their common grounding in the deep well of local tradition found in the mountains of Western North Carolina. As young lovers of old-time music, Pretty Little Goat began winning string band competitions right away. Over the last six years the Goats have collaborated with many well respected local musicians including Jamie Laval, Blake Ellege, members of the Steep Canyon Rangers, Jeff Sipe, Jonathan Grey of Jump Little Children and many others. Members of the band are dedicated mentors to the next generation of musicians. Always looking for new and exciting ways to inspire young people, they have been deeply involved in the local JAM (Junior Appalachian Musicians) program, music camps, schools and more.

### Score

- **Total:** 15/30
- **Rarity:** 4/10
- **Uniqueness:** 6/10
- **Magnitude:** 5/10
- **Reasoning:** Monthly First‑Saturday recurring event (not highly rare) but a themed house-music takeover with local DJ talent and strong community vibes gives it above-average uniqueness; held in a small brewery taproom so regional draw is modest (professional local).

**AI Summary:** Bass-forward house and tech-house sets transform a warm taproom into a communal late-night first-Saturday dance party; local DJs Hackett, DJ G3X, and Tapz spin groove-driven, peak-time mixes.

### Score

- **Total:** 13/30
- **Rarity:** 4/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 4/10
- **Reasoning:** A typical Saturday-night paid pub gig — not especially rare but also not a weekly headliner (hence mid rarity). Charismatic, high-energy classic soul/blues by seasoned local/Atlanta players gives decent entertainment value but isn’t conceptually novel. Jack of the Wood is a well-known intimate local venue (professional local draw), so scale is solidly local rather than regional.

**AI Summary:** Charismatic, high energy classic soul, blues and R&B delivered by a five-piece band of seasoned Asheville and Atlanta musicians, channeling Howlin’ Wolf, Freddie King, and Johnny “Guitar” Watson in an intimate late-night pub set.

### Description

Soul Blue is a charismatic and entertaining classic Soul/Blues/R&B band whose five members hail from both Asheville, NC, and Atlanta, GA. These seasoned musicians come together from a variety of popular local bands such as The Hunter Brothers Band, River Rock, Daddy’s Money, The XL’s, and Banks and Shane, enabling them to create an authentic approach to the music of many best-loved Soul, Blues, and R&B artists such as Howlin’ Wolf, Freddie King, Johnny “Guitar” Watson, James Cotton, Little Milton, Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley, Ted Taylor,James Brown, Wilson Pickett, Marvin Gaye, Otis Redding, Al Green, Smokey Robinson, Aretha Franklin, Janis Joplin, Prince, Ann Peebles, Martha Reeves and The Vandellas, The Spinners, Taj Mahal, Delbert McClinton, Keb’ Mo’, Jimmy Hall, John Mayer, The Allman Brothers. The Rolling Stones, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Samantha Fish, and many more. Soul Blue’s combined love for the music and each other as long-time friends creates an all-around great chemistry and captivating good time, sure to draw you in. So, if this music and vibe describe you, grab a friend and come on out to join Soul Blue for some of the very best in Classic Soul, Blues, and R&B. They’d love nothing better than to spend this good time with you.

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP (ID: 312553059)

### Score

- **Total:** 17/30
- **Rarity:** 5/10
- **Uniqueness:** 8/10
- **Magnitude:** 4/10
- **Reasoning:** Weekly Sunday ecstatic/conscious dance (recurring) so not rare, but facilitator-led early‑morning waves have strong local 'Asheville weird' main‑character energy (+2) and higher-than-average uniqueness; community-scale draw at a local movement collective rather than a regional touring headliner.

**AI Summary:** Guided conscious movement across two early-morning dance waves with warmups and opening circles led by facilitator Ted Riskin; doors close at the opening circle to preserve a safe, containered group practice.

### Description

Sunday, January 4th

1st Dance Wave 8:30\-10:30am \| Warmup 8:30am \| Opening Circle 9am
2nd Dance Wave 10:30\-12:30am \| Warmup 10:30am \| Opening Circle 11am
Facilitator Ted Riskin

Intention: Dance Like a Child
“Babies don’t perform movement — they discover it.” - Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen

From a recent NYTimes article:
Babies and toddlers are un-self-conscious when they dance. They’re spontaneous, present, unconcerned with who’s watching them. This approach brings us back to our own intelligent bodies, our own basic understanding of what it is to be alive.

Do adults perform movement when they dance? They do. We do. We have no choice — we’ve done it before, so each time we dance we’re re-enacting the remnants of every time we’ve danced previously. We try and fail and try again to catch the rhythm; we think about how we’re being perceived. But what a privilege it is to move, even if it’s awkward, to be embodied and expressing and trying to be responsive to a beat, to be more subject and less object.

So much of our movement is just using our bodies like reliable vehicles to get ourselves from one place to another. Dancing is an act of remembering that, once, when we were small, everything was new. Once, we moved our bodies primarily in order to play, express and discover. The more online we become, the farther we drift from our earliest soundtrack, the rhythm that’s in us before we’re born, the basslike thump-thump of our mother’s heartbeat and the oontz-oontz of her circulating blood. You can watch adults learning from a toddler here and here.

\~\~\~

\*\* Please note that the dance starts at Warm up. The doors close promptly at Opening Circle and people who arrive late will be turned away. Please be on time to ensure a safe and secure container. \*\*

Location: Evergreen Community Charter School, 50 Bell Road, Asheville NC, 28805

Ticket Price: $15-30 or name your price.
No one turned away for lack of funds!

- **Reasoning:** Monthly Rosicrucian convocation is a recurring, missable-but-regular event (monthly = mid rarity). Its esoteric AMORC rituals and psychic/ritual experiments give it strong niche 'Asheville weird' main-character energy (+2 boost), but it’s held at a small community venue with a local membership draw, so overall magnitude is low.

**AI Summary:** Casual Sunday-morning coffee conversations for secular, like-minded non-believers in a bright café, with twice-monthly book-club meetups at a local pizzeria and occasional Wednesday brewery evening gatherings.

### Description

**We hope you will come meet some of the group** this coming **Sunday morning** **(10AM - noon)** or some time soon. We meet every Sunday at **Earth Fare's cafe** for just conversation among like-minded non-believers.
In addition, two Sundays per month we also have a **Book Club** that meets at **Standard Pizza on Biltmore**. We also have Wednesday evening meetings at either **Boodas Brewing or Trailside in Hendersonville** once a month. You should receive emails about each of those events and are welcome to attend.
Please sign up here in Meetup to receive notices about our activities. There are no dues. Thanks!

Our newly-formed group has 100+ members already. Our conversation groups are usually 10-15 people and have been excellent. We chat about atheism, but also about **other things that are not related to religion** etc at all.

**None of us believe in religion.** Some of us wonder if "the universe" or something energy-related affects our lives, while others feel that someday science will be able to explain time-without-beginning and other mysteries.

**Until further notice our Sunday get togethers will be 10AM - noon** at the **cafe at Earth Fare.** RSVP is requested but not required.

The address is **66 Westgate Pkwy, Asheville**. **Earth Fare** is a large and excellent "health supermarket". It's in the Westgate Shopping Center, which is right off Patton after crossing the bridge on 240 West. Earth Fare is at the far end of the parking lot. There is plenty of free parking. They have a **very nice cafe** that you'll find off to the left after entering the store. The grocery area also has some good deals - see https://www.earthfare.com/#about

We’ll have a sign so you can see what table(s) we are using. Bringing kids and dogs is not recommended.

Because we appreciate each participant, **suggestions and input are welcome**. Let's start with **your input** about these things...

- **Rarity:** 7/10
- **Uniqueness:** 6/10
- **Magnitude:** 5/10
- **Reasoning:** Two-day, limited-run skills workshop (missable) led by a local improviser at a small studio — solid, focused improv training with good “main character” energy for participants but modest scale and local draw.

**AI Summary:** Sharpen improv scene work through choice making drills, timing exercises, and cleaner edits to strengthen ensemble connection and show flow, led by Asheville improviser Stevie Ramirez in a hands on studio workshop.

### Description

Create sharper scenes, cleaner edits, and stronger connections. Learn to improve your timing, teamwork, and show flow—whether playing with close friends or new teammates.

Saturday, January 3rd | 12 - 3 pm

Sharpen your performance with a toolkit built for stronger, smarter improv. In this workshop, we’ll explore techniques for well-timed scene edits, effective blackout lines/scene punctuation, and creating dynamic group opportunities. You’ll practice making your scene partners shine, finding the perfect moments for callbacks, and tuning your sense of timing and energy to elevate every show.

Whether you’re working with familiar teammates or new collaborators, you’ll leave with the tools to play boldly, connect deeply, and keep your shows flowing.

This workshop will operate on a sliding scale. Select the price that works for your budget, or get in touch with me personally if you would like a discounted or free spot, as made possible by generous local sponsors.

### Description

**We’ll explore the combination of meditation and journaling in accessing deeper levels of wisdom and understanding. We’ll set the stage with an ancient Taoist poem written by a hermit monk. The most famous of these poems is the Tao te Ching, but they wrote thousands of other poems, some equally as beautiful and mysterious. We’ll explore in our journals the hidden currents that affect the quality of our lives – the underlying stories and experiences that shape our lives without us knowing it. The layer beneath the stories we tell ourselves.**

**Bring a journal to write in and a pen.**

## In-Person Connection Practice

**Date:** Sunday, January 4, 2026 at 3:30 PM

**Organizer:** SeekHealing Asheville

### Score

- **Total:** 5/30
- **Rarity:** 1/10
- **Uniqueness:** 2/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Weekly recurring event - happens every week.

**AI Summary:** Facilitated small group practice in deep listening and vulnerable conversation, with rotating roles (facilitator and 'Space Owl'), focused on cultivating genuine interpersonal connection and emotional presence while avoiding advice.

### Description

A Connection Practice is a meeting to practice your skills in listening and connecting with others. No conversation topic is off limits. The only objective of the meeting is to feel a genuine sense of connection by the time it's over, and the only rule is that we promise to not give each other advice.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates.

**Organizer:** St. Matthias Episcopal Church

**Price:** Free

### Score

- **Total:** 13/30
- **Rarity:** 5/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** A one-night church concert in a local concert series — missable but not ultra-rare (monthly/seasonal feel). Musically charming (mountain folk/bluegrass/gospel) but similar to many local acoustic shows, so moderate uniqueness. Intimate, community-scale draw in a church sanctuary (hyper-local magnitude).

### Description

 The band is comprised of six local Episcopalians from the Asheville area. The concert will feature mountain folk music, bluegrass and traditional gospel along with other genres spread across their repertoire.

## NEW DATE: Book Club: Why People Believe Weird Things, by Michael Shermer

**Date:** Sunday, January 4, 2026 at 4:00 PM

**Location:** Standard Pizza, 755 Biltmore Ave., Asheville, NC (28806)

**Organizer:** Atheists of WNC

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP (ID: 312222329)

**Tags:** Book Club, Community, Science Skepticism, Nonfiction Discussion, Small Group Meetup, Casual Pizza Parlor

### Score

- **Total:** 10/30
- **Rarity:** 3/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Recurring local book-club meeting (easy to miss but not rare), niche/skepticism theme gives decent character, small community meetup in a pizza-parlor back room so very low draw.

**AI Summary:** Critical discussion of Michael Shermer’s Why People Believe Weird Things (Part Three, chapters 9–11; ~45 pages) in Standard Pizza’s back room, where Atheists of WNC unpack pseudoscience and reasoning over casual pizza.

### Description

**Our next meeting** is **Sunday, January 4, 4 p.m. at Standard Pizza, 755 Biltmore Avenue in Asheville**.

Look for us inside, in the back room.

We will continue our discussion of ***Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time***, by science writer [Michael Shermer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Shermer). We will focus on Part three, chapters 9 to 11, which is around 45 pages.

From the forward: "Unless we regularly use human reason both to discover and acknowledge nature's factuality, and to follow the logical implications for efficacious human action that such knowledge entails, we will lose out to the frightening forces of irrationality, romanticism, uncompromising "true"belief, and the apparent resulting inevitability of mob action. Skepticism is the agent of reason against organized irrationalism and is therefore one of the keys to human social and civic decency."

Note: Each section stands alone and is prime for discussion, so newcomers are welcome!
We would like to keep each meeting to a max of 10 people. **Please RSVP** if you do plan to come.

### Score

- **Total:** 8/30
- **Rarity:** 1/10
- **Uniqueness:** 3/10
- **Magnitude:** 4/10
- **Reasoning:** A routine solo saxophone set at a neighborhood wine bar with many similar weekly shows at this venue, so it's low-urgency and fairly common, mildly pleasant/nostalgic but not highly novel, and a modest local professional production.

**AI Summary:** Saxophone performance at 5 Walnut Wine Bar featuring Tom Tesser performing live instrumental sets. Ideal for wine bar patrons and fans of intimate live music.

## Introduction to creativity journaling

**Date:** Sunday, January 4, 2026 at 4:00 PM

**Location:** The Radical Hotel, 95 Roberts Street,, Asheville, NC (28806)

**Organizer:** Asheville Creativity Journaling Meetup Group

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP (ID: 312379683)

**Tags:** Meditation, Education, Wellness, Community, Creativity Journaling, Guided Meditation, Songwriting Focused, Beginner Friendly, Introspective Creative Workshop

### Score

- **Total:** 10/30
- **Rarity:** 2/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** A free, beginner-friendly Meetup workshop on journaling/meditation that appears to be recurring (many similar dates listed), so it's easy to catch — modestly interesting and introspective but small-scale and hyper-local at a boutique venue.

**AI Summary:** Guided journaling and meditative exercises to nurture the shy inner voice and spark songwriting, helping artists drop beneath the busy surface mind to sense emergent creative material.

### Description

* **We’ll explore the use of journaling and meditation in creative work. We’ll nurture the song within and see what that shy inner voice wants to tell us. It is about listening first – sensing what wants to become. This is a forum where artists can drop beneath the busy surface mind and listen for what's trying to emerge.**

**There are moments in our lives, there are moments in a day, when we seem to see beyond the usual--become clairvoyant. We reach then into reality. Such are the moments of our greatest happiness. Such are the moments of our greatest vision....At such times there is a song going on within us, a song to which we listen. It fills us with surprise. We marvel at it. We would continue to hear it. But few are capable of holding themselves in the state of listening to their song. Intellectuality steps in and as the song within us is of the utmost sensitiveness, it retires in the presence of the cold, material intellect. It is aristocratic and will not associate itself with the commonplace--and we fall back and become our ordinary selves. Yet we live in the memory of these songs which in moments of intellectual inadvertence have been possible to us. They are the pinnacles of our experience and it is the desire to express these intimate sensations, this song from within, which motivates the masters of all art.**
**\- Robert Henri from The Art**

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP (ID: 312196701)

**Tags:** Book Club, Nightlife, Beer, Silent Reading, Fantasy Science Fiction, Introvert Friendly, Bring Your Book, Disco Ball Room

### Score

- **Total:** 12/30
- **Rarity:** 3/10
- **Uniqueness:** 7/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Low-urgency, likely recurring introvert-friendly meet-up at a local bar (Day Trip). The disco-ball back room and silent reading format give it niche, 'Asheville' charm (bonus to uniqueness), but it’s a small-scale, hyper-local event.

**AI Summary:** Quiet communal reading of fantasy and science fiction in Day Trip's back room beneath a disco ball; brief social check ins followed by silent reading with drinks and an introvert friendly, low key atmosphere.

### Description

BOYB - Bring Your Own Book and spill the beer (literally and metaphorically) on your current favorite Fantasy and Sci-fi titles at Day Trip! We will likely be in the large ‘back room’ (with the Disco Ball)

**What is a Silent Book Club?**
Referred to as "Introvert's Happy Hour", Silent Book clubs allow readers to engage with each other without the commitment of reading a shared title. Community members gather in the same place, have some casual chit chat, and then read silently together. **This group will focus on Fantasy and Sci-Fi titles (subgenres & related genres are welcome!)**

**How does it work?**
For the first 15-30 mins we will gather, grab our food and drink and engage in introductions. Feel free to discuss your recent favorites, mention a title that lives in your head rent free, or ask for recommendations! The best part of the Silent Book Club is being able to talk shop with other readers!

Once settled in we will dedicate 45 minutes to silent reading. Your book can be traditional, ebook, or audiobook. Read at your own pace!

Afterwards we will go around show-and-tell style and share what we read with the group. We want to know what you're reading! Organic dialogue welcome!

### Score

- **Total:** 13/30
- **Rarity:** 2/10
- **Uniqueness:** 8/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** Recurring weekly community kirtan at The Well — low missability (regular series) so rarity is low, but a niche, heart-centered devotional chant with strong 'Asheville' spiritual vibe earns high uniqueness (+Asheville-weird bonus). Small community venue = modest local draw.

**AI Summary:** Call-and-response kirtan with devotional chants and communal singing that cultivates a warm, heart-centered atmosphere; open to all musical levels for mantra-led vocal practice and gentle spiritual connection.

### Score

- **Total:** 18/30
- **Rarity:** 5/10
- **Uniqueness:** 8/10
- **Magnitude:** 5/10
- **Reasoning:** A month-long, seasonally rotating exhibition (multi-visit pass) is moderately missable but not a one-off (rarity 5). The immersive, multimedia exploration of “home” has strong high-concept/Main-Character energy and local contemporaryEDGE (unique 8). It’s a professional, gallery-level show with community programming (local/regional draw) rather than a major touring or stadium act (magnitude 5).

**AI Summary:** Immersive installations use domestic objects, ambient sound, and video to explore “home” as a vessel; a month-long pass provides multi-visit access to rotating contemporary artworks and community programming by REVOLVE.

### Description

You will be provided with your sanitized supplies, or feel free to bring your own colored pencils, markers, or other art supplies to express yourself during this Connection Practice Meeting.

A Connection Practice is a meeting to practice your skills in listening and connecting with others. No conversation topic is off limits. The only objective of the meeting is to feel a genuine sense of connection by the time it's over, and the only rule is that we promise to not give each other advice.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates. All connection practices are free of charge.

**Location:** Little Jumbo Bar, 241 Broadway St., Asheville, NC (28801)

**Organizer:** Little Jumbo Bar

**Price:** Free

**Source:** AVL_TODAY (ID: 16112203)

**Tags:** Live Music, Jazz Quintet, Blue Ridge Jazz, Intimate Bar Setting, Improvisational

### Score

- **Total:** 17/30
- **Rarity:** 5/10
- **Uniqueness:** 7/10
- **Magnitude:** 5/10
- **Reasoning:** A one-night jazz quintet in an intimate downtown bar — part of Asheville’s active jazz circuit so not truly one-off (moderately missable). Musically interesting and improvisational with an Asheville/Blue Ridge vibe (+2 “weird” bonus), but at a small local venue rather than a regional headliner.

**AI Summary:** Alchemical interplay among five musicians channels Blue Ridge authenticity into sophisticated harmonic exploration and improvisational risk taking, performed in an intimate bar setting that encourages adventurous, attentive jazz listening.

### Description

The Core represents everything essential about Asheville's jazz DNA distilled into five musicians who understand that the best ensembles aren't just collections of individual talents-they're alchemical reactions where individual voices merge into something greater than their sum. This quintet embodies the mountain city's unique musical ecosystem, where Blue Ridge authenticity meets sophisticated harmonic exploration, where the intimacy of local venues allows for the kind of musical risk-taking that transforms standards into personal statements. Named for their ability to get to the heart of every song they touch, The Core strips away musical pretense to reveal the emotional architecture beneath, proving that jazz at its best isn't about showing off-it's about showing up completely for each moment, each phrase, each possibility that emerges when five musicians breathe together in perfect musical democracy. In Asheville's thriving jazz scene, The Core stands as both inheritors of tradition and pioneers of what's next, reminding audiences that the most profound musical experiences happen when virtuosity serves vulnerability, when technique becomes the vehicle for something infinitely more human.

- **Uniqueness:** 2/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Weekly recurring event - happens every week.

**AI Summary:** Spontaneous alchemical improvisations from a four-piece ensemble navigating free form textures and concentrated motifs; original compositions and on the spot transmutations blend jazz, experimental, and ambient elements in an intimate bar setting.

### Description

Sanders, Boyd, Page & Hall distill the pure essence of improvisational expression, converging as alchemists of sound, transmuting musical elements into their most essential forms. This quartet embodies the philosophical concept of quintessence-the fifth element beyond earth, air, fire, and water-representing the fundamental substance from which all musical reality springs. Their original compositions crystallize the essential qualities of diverse influences, oscillating between through-composed musical themes, groove-based soul explorations, traditional jazz-influenced pieces, Americana-inspired peaceful melodicism, world music influences, free jazz adventures, and occasional forays into cacophonous noise music. Through years of improvisational study, they've learned to access that rarefied space where genres dissolve into pure creative energy. In this musical laboratory, Sanders' guitar becomes a conduit for universal vibration, Boyd's reeds channel the breath of consciousness itself, Page's bass provides the fundamental frequency of existence, while Hall's percussion creates the rhythmic heartbeat of the cosmos.

**Organizer:** AVL Digital Nomads

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP (ID: 308333805)

**Tags:** Book Club, Beer, Community, Local Author, Literary Fiction, Indigenous Themes, Digital Nomads, Brewery Meetup

### Score

- **Total:** 13/30
- **Rarity:** 4/10
- **Uniqueness:** 6/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** Monthly-ish brewery book club featuring a local author and a planning session for six months—intimate, community-forward and slightly 'Asheville' in vibe (digital-nomad + brewery), but a small local draw.

**AI Summary:** Intimate book club at a relaxed brewery discussing Annette Clapsaddle’s Even As We Breathe—exploring Cherokee displacement, bone and blood imagery—and collecting member suggestions to plan six months of future selections.

### Description

**January Selection - *Even As We Breathe* by Annette Clapsaddle (local author)**

+ Bring your book suggestions for planning. We’ll plan out the next 6 months of selections.

Even As We Breathe invokes the elements of bone, blood, and flesh as Cowney navigates difficult social, cultural, and ethnic divides. After leaving the seclusion of the Cherokee reservation, he is able to explore a future free from the consequences of his family's choices and to construct a new worldview, for a time. However, prejudice and persecution in the white world of the resort eventually compel Cowney to free himself from larger forces that hold him back as he struggles to unearth evidence of his innocence and clear his name.

**Welcome** to our robust and engaging Book Club! We're a small, friendly group dedicated to fostering lively discussions about our monthly book selections. Whether you've read the entire book, just a few chapters, or even if you're simply curious about the title, we'd love to have you join us!

**Book Selection:** We encourage active participation in choosing our reading material. During each meeting, members have the opportunity to suggest and vote on the next book. Feel free to post your book recommendations in the comments section as well - we're always excited to explore new literary adventures!

**Meeting Schedule**: We gather on the First Tuesday of every month for our book discussions.
What sets us apart is our small group size and directed discussions. This intimate setting allows for deeper, more engaging conversations where everyone's voice can be heard. It's the perfect environment for those who love to dive deep into themes, characters, and the intricacies of storytelling.

So whether you're a seasoned bookworm or just dipping your toes into the world of literature, we invite you to join us. Let's explore new worlds, challenge our perspectives, and forge new friendships - one book at a time!

**February Pick: *TBD***

**Location:** Sweets and Seats, 77, 81 Patton Ave,, Asheville, NC (28806)

**Organizer:** Shut Up & Write!® Western North Carolina

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP (ID: 311845856)

**Tags:** Education, Community, 60 Minute Sprints, Drop In Friendly, Quiet Coworking, All Genres Welcome, Coffeehouse Venue

### Score

- **Total:** 5/30
- **Rarity:** 1/10
- **Uniqueness:** 2/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Weekly recurring event - happens every week.

**AI Summary:** Timed 60-minute heads-down writing sprints with brief introductions, where writers tackle novels, poems, song lyrics, résumés, or reports in a quiet coffeehouse while a facilitator runs a strict timer.

### Description

Shut Up & Write!

**Here's how it works.** Show up at or before 6:00. At 6:00, we do some quick introductions. Afterward, for a full 60 minutes (I'll set a timer!) we are heads-down writing. Writing what? A novel? You bet. Some poetry? Sure. Song lyrics? Your resume? That report you need to get to your boss before 8 AM or you'll *need* *to write* that resume? All of the above and more. Just shut up and write.

Surrounding ourselves with other writers who are busy putting words onto page (physical or virtual) keeps us all accountable and focused.

When the timer goes off, we'll check-in with each other and see how it went. Afterward, feel free to stay to chat and get to know your fellow writers, or keep writing, or take off.

Socializing is optional and will happen after (or briefly before) the focused writing. This is a safe space to work on your craft. No one will read or critique your writing.

For more information about our events, visit [https://shutupwrite.com](https://shutupwrite.com).

**What to Expect**

* Roughly 15 minutes of introductions
* 60 minutes of focused writing (somebody set a timer)!
* Afterward, optional socializing

**Being late is okay:** Just show up and get settled, then check in with the host after the session. (Look for the person with the Shut Up & Write sign).

**What Should I Bring?**

* Whatever you need to be able to write!
* Earbuds/earplugs if you want to block ambient noise.

**Other Important Details:**

HOSTS: This is a multi-host event, so most of the time there will be a host present. If we are unlucky and no host can attend, please find each other and self-organize. Pay attention to the event chat and comments to see who is available.

WI-FI: Yes!

PARKING: Street parking in metered spots is free after 6pm. Closest municipal garages ($2/hour) are Wall St. & Coxe Street/Sears Alley.

## Basic Preparedness: Lessons Learned after Hurricane Helene with Levi & Marian

**Date:** Tuesday, January 6, 2026 at 6:00 PM

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP (ID: 312386326)

**Tags:** Education, Community, Emergency Preparedness, Storm Lessons, Power Outage Tips, Neighborhood Readiness

### Score

- **Total:** 15/30
- **Rarity:** 7/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** A timely, one-off community conversation prompted by Hurricane Helene (moderately urgent), useful educational focus but not highly novel, and held in a small local community space (limited draw).

**AI Summary:** Community conversation collecting practical emergency preparedness lessons learned during Hurricane Helene, where neighbors compare notes on power outage strategies, supply chain workarounds, and essentials for resilient home and neighborhood readiness.

### Description

Join us for an open community conversation inspired by the recent experiences surrounding Hurricane Helene. This gathering is meant to bring people together to share stories, compare notes, and identify the practical lessons we can all carry forward. We’ll talk about the basics of preparedness, what actually matters when the power is out or supply chains are disrupted, and what we each learned from navigating the storm.

This first session is designed to be collaborative. Instead of a formal workshop, we’ll use our time to build a community-generated list of future topics and skill-building sessions. Whether you’re brand new to preparedness or have insights to contribute, your perspective is welcome. Our goal is to create an ongoing series of discussions and workshops shaped by the needs and interests of the group.
Come ready to share, learn, and help strengthen our community’s resilience.

Donations are welcome to support the venue.

## Asheville Mardi Gras Twelfth Night

**Date:** Tuesday, January 6, 2026 at 6:00 PM

**Location:** The Funkatorium, 147 Coxe Ave, Asheville, NC (28801)

**Price:** $15 – $25

**Source:** MOUNTAIN_X (ID: mx-1010073)

**Tags:** Dance, Nightlife, Live Music, DJ Paul Sena, King Cake, Coronation Ceremony, Mardi Gras Celebration, Brewery Taproom

### Score

- **Total:** 20/30
- **Rarity:** 7/10
- **Uniqueness:** 8/10
- **Magnitude:** 5/10
- **Reasoning:** Annual Twelfth Night coronation is a seasonal one-off (missable if you skip Jan 6) with strong Asheville-Mardi Gras flair — DJ Paul Sena, king cake and a coronation give it high novelty; held in The Funkatorium taproom so the draw is solidly local/professional rather than regional.

**AI Summary:** Late night Mardi Gras revelry with DJ Paul Sena spinning danceable beats, king cake served, and an Asheville Mardi Gras 2026 coronation ceremony at The Funkatorium's brewery taproom.

### Description

Make merry and live it up at Twelfth Night where you can dance to DJ Paul Sena, enjoy some king cake, and find out who will be the Asheville Mardi Gras 2026 monarchs.

### Score

- **Total:** 17/30
- **Rarity:** 5/10
- **Uniqueness:** 8/10
- **Magnitude:** 4/10
- **Reasoning:** Part of a weekly Tuesday series (so not super rare) but billed as a one‑time mandolin-focused showcase with a rotating cast — a niche, high‑concept bluegrass/Americana night (Asheville‑weird bonus) in an intimate Brevard listening room; solid local/regional draw rather than a large touring headliner.

**AI Summary:** One-time-only mandolin-focused jam night blending bluegrass, Americana, blues, country, and funk with a rotating cast of local and touring musicians in an intimate listening-room setting.

### Description

Launched in August of 2020, Tuesday Casual Collaborations at 185 King Street has become a cornerstone of the vibrant Brevard music community. Every week Travis Book assembles a unique group of musicians for a one-time-only show, drawing on his vast network of friends and growing repertoire of musical styles. From Bluegrass to Blues, Songwriter to Americana, Country to Funk, Travis and his ever-evolving cast of local and national (even international) musicians consistently hit the sweet spot between preparation and spontaneity. “Eventually, I hope to play with everyone!” he occasionally boasts, and he’s well on his way. Travis has hosted a wide range of musicians, including: Anders Beck, Nicki Bluhm, Josh Daniel, Beppe Gambetta, Mike Guggino, Vince Herman, Sierra Hull, Cris Jacobs, Jim Lauderdale, Lindsay Lou, Steve McMurry, Mimi Naja, Tim O’Brien, Woody Platt, Jon Stickley, Kyle Tuttle, and Cristina Vane. He also regularly employs the skills of world-class local musicians like Jeff Sipe, Mike Ashworth, Tommy Maher, Bennett Sullivan, and Derick Gardner. Every week is unique, the musical styles wide-ranging, but the one thing that remains constant is the intention, positivity, and charisma that Travis brings to each and every show. This week’s show will be hosted by Mike Guggino of the Steep Canyon Rangers. He will be bringing a group of his favorite mandolin players.

### Score

- **Total:** 18/30
- **Rarity:** 7/10

- **Reasoning:** Weekly recurring event - happens every week.

**AI Summary:** Atmospheric jazz quartet performing original, through-composed pieces and free improvisations that distill improvisational expression into elemental, experimental soundscapes; intimate lounge setting ideal for attentive late-night listeners.

### Description

Sanders, Boyd, Page & Hall distill the pure essence of improvisational expression, converging as alchemists of sound, transmuting musical elements into their most essential forms. This quartet embodies the philosophical concept of quintessence—the fifth element beyond earth, air, fire, and water—representing the fundamental substance from which all musical reality springs. Their original compositions crystallize the essential qualities of diverse influences, oscillating between through-composed musical themes, groove-based soul explorations, traditional jazz-influenced pieces, Americana-inspired peaceful melodicism, world music influences, free jazz adventures, and occasional forays into cacophonous noise music. Through years of improvisational study, they've learned to access that rarefied space where genres dissolve into pure creative energy. In this musical laboratory, Sanders' guitar becomes a conduit for universal vibration, Boyd's reeds channel the breath of consciousness itself, Page's bass provides the fundamental frequency of existence, while Hall's percussion creates the rhythmic heartbeat of the cosmos. Will Boyd - Sax, Flute, Clarinet, EWI Zack Page - Acoustic & Electric Bass Alan Hall - Drums Jay Sanders - Guitar and Effects Every Monday and Tuesday, Little Jumbo brings live jazz to your ears. littlejumbobar.com “Simply put, Little Jumbo should be at the top of your list of places for cocktails in Asheville. The drinks and service are both top-notch, and the atmosphere is reminiscent of a relaxed speakeasy, without a trace of the pretention that can sometimes be found in such places.” ~ The SmokyMountains.com Local Expert Team

### Description

A Connection Practice is a meeting to practice your skills in listening and connecting with others. No conversation topic is off limits. The only objective of the meeting is to feel a genuine sense of connection by the time it's over, and the only rule is that we promise to not give each other advice.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates.

## Free Yoga Nidra Classes

**Date:** Wednesday, January 7, 2026 at 4:30 PM

**Location:** Pack Memorial Library, 67 Haywood St. , Asheville, NC (28801)

**Organizer:** Pack Memorial Library

**Price:** Free

**Source:** AVL_TODAY (ID: 17170930)

**Tags:** Meditation, Wellness, Community, Yoga Nidra, Deep Relaxation, Beginner Friendly, Mats Provided, Library Program

### Score

- **Total:** 11/30
- **Rarity:** 4/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** A free, one-off library wellness program — low missability but not weekly/constant; Yoga Nidra is a pleasant, slightly niche offering (moderately unique) but it's a small community class (10 mats) at a local library, so limited draw.

**AI Summary:** Soothing guided non-sleep deep relaxation leads participants through progressive body awareness and breath cues to reduce stress, improve sleep, and rebalance the nervous system; mats available for ten people with registration.

### Description

Yoga Nidra is Non-Sleep Deep Relaxation

The restorative relaxation created while practicing Yoga Nidra invites people to reduce stress, improve sleep, and balance their nervous system, all while simply slowing down and listening to a soothing guided meditation. These benefits extend beyond the session, and with repetition support calm in your daily life.

The library can provide yoga mats for ten people. If you need a yoga mat, please register. If you plan on bringing a yoga mat, then simply show up. 

If you would like to attend this session virtually, please email **drea.dreiling@buncombenc.gov** before noon on the day of the workshop. You'll be emailed a link that will allow you to join the virtual meeting.

**About Kathy:** 

Kathy Reardon is a Certified Yoga Nidra facilitator with over 10 years experience guiding people through deep states of relaxation. She looks forward to joining you on this healing journey at Pack Library.

### Score

- **Total:** 10/30

- **Reasoning:** A routine city Planning & Zoning commission meeting — typically monthly and publicly scheduled — so it's missable for most but important for affected neighbors and developers. Low novelty or spectacle (standard civic process) with a modest local draw at City Hall.

**AI Summary:** Commissioners review Asheville land-use proposals, zoning map amendments, and development permits with staff presentations, scheduled public comment periods, and policy deliberations in City Hall's council chamber.

### Score

- **Total:** 21/30
- **Rarity:** 6/10
- **Uniqueness:** 8/10
- **Magnitude:** 7/10
- **Reasoning:** Quarterly, curated songwriter showcase (not weekly) so moderately rare; quirky 'roller derby' theme and curated hosts add strong Asheville-weird / main-character energy (+2); held at The Grey Eagle so a solid regional draw (intimate but reputable venue) with a surprise guest.

**AI Summary:** Four songwriters rollin' out originals and covers, elbows-n-all, in an intimate, welcoming set curated by Thomas Kozak and Jodi John Pippin, with a surprise guest joining for onstage collaborations.

### Description

The Songwriters Roller Derby Showcase, presented by the Asheville Songwriters Association, is a quarterly music show with no roller skates included – just four performers “rollin’ out the songs, elbows-n-all.” Curated and hosted by Thomas Kozak and Jodi John Pippin, each “Derby Night” at The Grey Eagle will showcase the craft of songwriting in an intimate and welcoming setting. As an added element of the Songwriters Roller Derby Showcase, a surprise guest will join the performers on stage for interactive, on-the-spot commentary ~ a “look under the hood of the songwriting process” of sorts. The audience will have a chance to share comments as well, if they are inspired to do so. For most of the evening, the songwriters will perform finished songs, but they will also each share a brand new song that has not yet been performed on stage. Come support the songwriters as they show their vulnerable side and help nurture the art and craft of songwriting in the region and beyond.

SHOW: 7PM

Purchase Tickets: https://www.etix.com/ticket/servlet/s/38220861

The Songwriters Roller Derby Showcase, presented by the Asheville Songwriters Association, is a quarterly music show with no roller skates included - just four performers "rollin' out the songs, elbows-n-all." Curated and hosted by Thomas Kozak and Jodi John Pippin, each "Derby Night" at The Grey Eagle will showcase the craft of songwriting in an intimate and welcoming setting.  As an added element of the Songwriters Roller Derby Showcase, a surprise guest will join the performers on stage for interactive, on-the-spot commentary ~ a "look under the hood of the songwriting process" of sorts. The audience will have a chance to share comments as well, if they are inspired to do so. For most of the evening, the songwriters will perform finished songs, but they will also each share a brand new song that has not yet been performed on stage. Come support the songwriters as they show their vulnerable side and help nurture the art and craft of songwriting in the region and beyond.

The performers for this 2nd Derby are:
Will Hartz - A born entertainer and a multi instrumentalist, Will Hartz has been putting on a show for all to see before he could speak. With Appalachian funk and southern soul pouring through his fingertips, Will is best known for his ability to grab the attention of any and all audiences with his refined stylistic performances. Will started playing piano at the age of 8, later translating into years of musical theatre and a BA in musical performance. 

Andrea Rosal - Andrea picked up a guitar at age 40, started writing soon after and was hooked. The 2024 winner of Womansong of Asheville’s inaugural songwriting competition, Andrea has written her way through a global pandemic, cancer, parenting two kids, Hurricane Helene, and all the ups and downs of everyday life.

Self-Care and Community of Practice Led by Black Facilitators, for the Black Community.

About this Event
"Caring for myself is not self - indulgence; it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare." Audre Lorde

This is an invitation specifically for persons who identify as Black or African American and are overwhelmed with the injustice of the world and are ready to create space in their lives for self-care as we fight for justice for all! (We offer a parallel session for Allies to connect, learn and find support in their work to dismantle racism at allies.eventbrite.com)

We believe Black people deserve a space to relax, reassess, and realign ourselves.

We are a collective of Black stress-management & wellness instructors inspired by human values.

We are here to facilitate your journey of trauma-relief and stress-management.

Imagine how much more energy you will have and how much more powerful you will be when you cut your stress levels in half!

And it can be done in just a few minutes using nothing but your own breath...

Over the last 10 years, we've taught over 100,000 people to do just that.
The key is that your breath is directly linked to your emotions.

This 1-Hour Restorative Session Includes:
-Open, safe space for sharing and self-care for Black people
-Facilitated discussion
-Breath work and meditation

Led by Black facilitators, certified in stress and trauma relief.
Unleash the Hidden Healing Power of the Breath

**AI Summary:** Hands-on peer workshop for early-stage founders focused on clarifying a venture’s highest-value proposition and sharpening concise pitch language, with facilitated feedback and next-step action planning in Hatchworks’ collaborative coworking space.

### Description

**Details**

You will walk away with more clarity on the highest value of your business or idea, and how to communicate it.

This is an event for people in idea stages:

You have some business or startup ideas to work through, or you are in the early stages of your existing business, or maybe you are adding a new aspect or direction to your business. It’s also great for people who just want to learn by helping others through those stages.

This event pairs perfectly with Hatch This, the weekend after. You’ll be able to get clear on your startup idea, and build confidence before Hatch This!

**How it will work:**

This is a collaborative learning event. You will work with just a few other people, presenting your ideas for feedback, and providing feedback for others. You will be guided by one of the mentors (listed below), who will provide a unique approach to dig deep and really define the how, what, and why behind your business or idea.

12:15 - Presentation

Mentors will walk through some tips to go from brainstorming, through defining a vision and crafting a pitch. You'll also get an idea of their unique approaches.

12:40 - Break into Groups

We'll divide the room for each mentor, and then break into even smaller groups of just a few people who you’ll collaboratively learn with.

Your mentor will guide a few small groups through a deep dive to gain clarity on the highest value of your business or idea, and how to communicate it.

- **Uniqueness:** 5/10

### Description

The Belle Curves is the primary creative vehicle for Troy-based singer-songwriter Delaney Hafener. A typical multi-hyphenate musician/bandleader/producer/instrumentalist, she has an atypical relationship to fame – she doesn’t want it. She doesn’t need it, and she’s not pursuing it. Delaney seeks authenticity, joy, and community through music-making. She has no choice but to write songs. Through songwriting she processes emotions and captures moments, sharing morsels of her ever-evolving worldview. Delaney mines the world for experiences to sing about like a photographer takes to the road.

### Score

- **Total:** 5/30
- **Rarity:** 1/10
- **Uniqueness:** 2/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Weekly recurring event - happens every week.

**AI Summary:** Facilitated small-group exercises focus on empathic listening and authentic connection, with a strict no-advice rule, time-managed prompts, and a volunteer Space Owl holding a confidential, nonjudgmental container for open conversation.

### Description

A Connection Practice is a meeting to practice your skills in listening and connecting with others. No conversation topic is off limits. The only objective of the meeting is to feel a genuine sense of connection by the time it's over, and the only rule is that we promise to not give each other advice.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates.

### Description

ALL AGESSTANDING/DANCING ROOM ONLY BEACH ATTIRE ENCOURAGED! THE GET RIGHT BAND The Get Right Band's "Summer in the Winter BEACH BASH" with special guests, Supatight! The sunny good times are going down on Friday, Jan 9th at The Grey Eagle. We're talking beach balls, tropical decorations, and most importantly, a contest for "best dressed." BEACHY ATTIRE ENCOURAGED! Tix on sale now, get 'em while they're hot (get it? hot? cause it's a summer thing?). The Get Right Band is a psychedelic indie rock group committed to relentlessly following their muses to honest self-expression, to whatever excites them and pushes them into unexplored territory, to capturing some version of truth. American Songwriter writes that the Asheville, NC based group, "filters 60's/70's psychedelia and 90's alternative rock through a modern lens-as if Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and Nirvana co-wrote an album produced by Danger Mouse and Dan Auerbach." The Get Right Band formed in 2011, built around the musical brotherhood that guitarist/singer/songwriter Silas Durocher and bassist Jesse Gentry have formed playing music together since middle school. Durocher, who is a trained composer and has been commissioned to write for symphonies and chamber groups, has guitar chops that can soothe or rage, with a charismatic swagger as frontman and singer. Gentry's virtuosic bass playing "catapults from elastic to nasty" (The Mountain Xpress). Completing the team is drummer extraordinaire Jaze Uries, who is also a singer, songwriter, producer, photographer, and DJ, and keys legend Chuck Lichtenberger, whose incredible playing has been a staple of the Asheville music scene for years. GRB has defined their sound through constant evolution, building to the hook-driven, synth-heavy pop/rock/psych band they are today. The Huffington Post writes, "their songs are infectious and take you immediately to a place. The lyrics are smart and bear weight." SUPATIGHT

### Description

Caverns Of Gold Showcase Benefit featuring Pink Eye, Lower Peaks, Why Why?, John Kirby Jr & the New Seniors Friday, January 09 Show: 8pm | Doors: 7pm The Orange Peel All Ages - under 12 requires venue approval Caverns of Gold began as a Bandcamp-exclusive compilation, bringing together nearly 280 bands from across the world who donated their music in support of WNC Hurricane Relief. What started as a one-time idea became proof of something bigger—that when music communities come together, even the deepest caverns of darkness can be illuminated with the golden light of solidarity and hope. You can still find the compilation, Caverns of Gold: A Benefit for WNC Hurricane Relief, exclusively on Bandcamp at cavernsofgold.bandcamp.com. Now, the spirit of that project takes the stage. On January 9, 2026, Caverns of Gold comes to The Orange Peel with a showcase featuring members of the core group of organizers who helped bring the original compilation to life. The night will feature electrifying sets from four of Asheville’s most dynamic acts: PINKEYE, Lower Peaks, Why Why?, and John Kirby Jr & the New Seniors. Each band brings its own energy and vision, from fierce punk urgency to indie experimentation and heartfelt songwriting. This show also carries forward Caverns of Gold’s commitment to community care. In partnership with ABCCM \(Asheville Buncombe Community Christian Ministry\), the event will host a warm clothing drive to support neighbors in need this winter. Audience members are encouraged to bring coats, jackets, hats, gloves, and other essentials to help ABCCM’s vital outreach work across Western North Carolina.

## Garden Apartments // Sufferin' Fools // PJ Bond

**Price:** $10

**Source:** MOUNTAIN_X (ID: mx-997679)

**Tags:** Americana, Reverb Rock, Lyrically Driven, Touring Singer Songwriter, Intimate Club

### Score

- **Total:** 16/30
- **Rarity:** 6/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 5/10
- **Reasoning:** Single-date stop by a touring singer‑songwriter at intimate local club (Fleetwood’s) — a mid‑level, lyrically driven Americana show that’s common in Asheville but not easily repeatable; solid regional draw, modestly distinctive vibe.

**AI Summary:** Lyrically dark, upbeat Americana and reverb-laden rock from a seasoned wandering songster, blending introspective acoustic storytelling with shimmering electric textures for a late-night intimate club set.

### Description

PJ Bond PJ Bond is a wandering songster who has traversed the American and European landscapes more times than he can easily count. He got his start over ten years ago in what was then called the DIY Indie scene, back when musicians still made money on CDs and people spent a lot of their time trying to get signed. A decade later, Bond’s lyrically dark but otherwise upbeat songs span from introspective Americana to reverb-laden rock from an earlier era. If forced to draw parallels and speak of influences, one might say he has drawn from the likes of Elliott Smith and Wilco, though he might prefer to credit Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan these days. When not traveling the globe, PJ currently lives in Asheville, NC, listening to country music, and making pizza. Sufferin' Fools The fine fellows in Sufferin' Fools congregate around the mountain made tunes of Cameron Thomas. Born and bred in the Carolinas, Thomas' songs share the humble joys, struggles and mysteries of a southern life - where it might lead you, who you meet, and what you bring back home. The band rides the dusty crossroads of Memphis country soul and Midwest power pop - kicking the dual guitars into overdrive for fun. The band's second EP, Forest for the Trees, was released on 9/26/25 and is available on all streaming platforms. Garden Apartments West Asheville trio, Garden Apartments, blend the best elements of Americana, Psych and 90's Indie Rock to create a unique but familiar sound. Tight and minimal arrangements provide the backdrop to Rustin Bragaw's immediately captivating voice, accompanied by the tasteful guitar work of Chris Pearson and the solid drumming of Daniel Hawkins. Each player brings years of recording and touring experience to the table. The trio has been playing around Asheville since late 2024 after releasing a self-titled EP, which is currently available on streaming platforms.

### Description

Come hang out with us over lattes and good conversation. We’ll swap ideas, talk about our goals (personal and/or professional), and share a few ways to actually move them forward.

**9:00-9:15 - Intros & Check-In**
Quick round: name, background, what brought you here today. Low pressure. No performance required.
**9:15-10:15 - The Deep Dive**
We go around the circle. Each person shares what they're working on (personal, professional, or both - your choice). Then the group asks questions and offers suggestions that may help you think differently.

## North Carolina Asheville Bulldogs Women's Basketball vs. Longwood Lancers

**Date:** Saturday, January 10, 2026 *(time not specified)*

**Location:** Kimmel Arena, One University Heights, Asheville, NC (28804)

**Organizer:** Kimmel Arena

**Price:** $55

**Source:** AVL_TODAY (ID: 17055916)

**Tags:** Sports, Family, Women's College, Ncaa Division I, Conference Matchup, On Campus Arena, Student Section

### Score

- **Total:** 16/30
- **Rarity:** 5/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 6/10
- **Reasoning:** Regular-season D-I conference matchup at Kimmel Arena — not a one-off (many similar home games), so moderately missable. Fun, lively student-section energy and family-friendly sports vibe make it solid but not highly novel. Mid-sized on‑campus arena and paid D-I game give it regional draw rather than strictly hyper-local or national headliner status.

**AI Summary:** Fast-paced Division I women's college basketball with physical defense, dynamic guards, and crowd driven home court energy; student section chants and concession stand staples create a lively afternoon conference matchup atmosphere.

## Second Saturday Storytime & Craft

**Date:** Saturday, January 10, 2026 at 11:00 AM

**Location:** Transylvania County Library, Brevard, 212 South Gaston Street, Brevard, NC (28712)

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MOUNTAIN_X (ID: mx-977259)

**Tags:** Family, Education, Art, Community, Ages Birth To 5, Early Literacy, Parent Caregiver Participation, Simple Paper And Glue Crafts, Songs And Movement

### Score

- **Total:** 9/30
- **Rarity:** 4/10
- **Uniqueness:** 3/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Monthly Second Saturday storytime at a local county library — recurring, family-focused literacy program with simple crafts. Low missability and mainstream format (small, hyper-local audience), modestly engaging for caregivers and kids but not a high‑concept or large draw.

**AI Summary:** Interactive morning storytime with songs, movement, and simple crafts for babies, toddlers, and preschoolers to promote early and emergent literacy at Transylvania County Library; caregivers join hands-on language-building activities.

### Description

11:00 am Family Storytime (birth – 5 years) 11:30 am Craft Time Join us for stories, songs, movement and more as we celebrate and promote early and emergent literacy at the Transylvania County Library! Same theme and craft as Tuesday storytime. More About Early and Emergent Literacy Babies, toddlers, preschoolers, in all stages of development with their parents and caregivers are welcome to our morning of celebration. Children start to learn language from the day they are born. As they grow and develop, their speech and language skills become increasingly more complex. During early speech and language development, children learn skills that are important to the development of literacy (reading and writing). This stage, known as emergent literacy, begins at birth and continues through the preschool years. From birth, babies listen to language patterns in everyday speech, as well as in rhyming, chanting, and singing – all of these play an important part in literacy development. As they develop, children see and interact with print in everyday situations. In everything from books and magazines to grocery lists, whether at home or in preschool, they are (and should be) encountering language in print well before they start elementary school. Parents can see their child’s growing appreciation and enjoyment of print as they begin to recognize words that rhyme, scribble with crayons, point out street signs and symbols, and name some letters of the alphabet. Gradually, children combine what they know about speaking and listening with what they know about print and become ready to learn to read and write. That’s what storytime at the library is all about!

This is an art form with historical roots in cultures from around the world, but is near and dear to our Appalachian musicians sharing heartfelt ballads as they travel through the valleys. Painted, printed, cut, and sewn scrolls show these stories as the cranker tells and sings them, inviting the audience along on the journey. The handmade meets the heartfelt, and the simple act of cranking becomes a spell — winding time, memory, and imagination together.

- **Reasoning:** Single seasonal, practical workshop (Jan 10) at Fifth Season Gardening — useful and locally relevant but not a one-off spectacle. Beginner-friendly garden education is solidly interesting but common in the area, and the draw is a small community/education crowd rather than a regional headliner.

**AI Summary:** Month-by-month walkthrough of seeding schedules, crop rotation strategies, planting windows, and harvest timing for vegetable gardens, with practical tips to optimize yields and succession planting. Held at a community garden center, beginner friendly.

- **Magnitude:** 5/10
- **Reasoning:** One-day, higher-priced deep-dive workshop (missable/special run). Strong, high-concept villain/character work for improvisors (interesting but not wildly novel). Local professional organizer at a small venue — solid local draw, not a regional headliner.

**AI Summary:** Deep-dive acting workshop teaching heel turns and antagonists to anchor scenes and heighten stakes through character work, scene-level choices, and interactive improvisation exercises for improvisors and actors seeking stronger conflicts and clearer hero-villain dynamics.

### Description

Learn how to anchor any story and heighten the stakes with a good heel turn. For improvisors and actors wanting to go deeper.

Most stories are only as good as their villains. Whether you are improvising long form stories or you've just been cast as the antagonist in someone else's story ... the villain is an immense opportunity to heighten the story, crystalize our hero, and draw the audience deeper into the world of the story. Besides, they're usually more fun to play anyway. We will explore villains across different genres, and give ourselves permission to take up a lot space.

This is an 8-week class series beginning on January 10 and meeting weekly until February 28.

## Portraits of Dignity: Do You See Me Now?  an exhibition by Joseph Pearson

### Score

- **Total:** 17/30
- **Rarity:** 6/10
- **Uniqueness:** 7/10
- **Magnitude:** 4/10
- **Reasoning:** A one-time opening for a new solo exhibition at the historic YMI — viewable beyond the opening so not ultra-rare, but a focused, empathetic portrait series by a notable local artist gives it strong thematic/Asheville appeal; modest regional draw at a respected local cultural venue.

**AI Summary:** Joseph Pearson's intimate figurative paintings, steeped in social realism and empathetic observation, present dignified portrait studies of overlooked individuals in the historic YMI Cultural Center, reframing visibility through meticulous brushwork.

### Description

Asheville, NC — On **January 10, 2026,** the historic **YMI Cultural Center** will open *“Portraits of Dignity: Do You See Me Now?,”* a compelling new body of figurative work by Asheville-based painter **Joseph Pearson.** Steeped in empathy, social realism, and decades of artistic discipline, this exhibition invites viewers to reconsider how society sees—or fails to see—the individuals who are so often overlooked.

Rooted in close observation and an unyielding respect for humanity, *“Portraits of Dignity”* offers a profound encounter with people whom society often consigns to the periphery. Each portrait becomes a moment of connection, asking viewers to slow down, look closer, and witness the dignity, complexity, and presence of individuals too often unseen.

“These are people we see peripherally, people we pass by,” says Pearson. “Doing this work required me to truly see them—to pay attention to their eyes, their expressions, the uniqueness of who they are. The question is simple: *Do you see me now?”*

**Pearson’s mission is to open folks’ awareness to our neighbors, considered on the fringe of our communities. A portion of any sale will be donated to favorite non-profits, like Pisgah Legal Services and  MANNA Food Bank. Joseph and his wife Gael hope folks will consider doing the same if they have not already done so.**

### Score

- **Total:** 11/30
- **Rarity:** 3/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10

**Date:** Saturday, January 10, 2026 at 8:00 PM

**Location:** Pisgah Brewing Company Black Mountain, 2948 US-70, Black Mountain (28711)

### Score

- **Total:** 11/30
- **Rarity:** 3/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** Local taproom bluegrass gig at Pisgah Black Mountain — a common, missable weekend show rather than a one-off or touring stop. Fun, high‑energy local string band gives it above-basic entertainment value, but the small taproom setting keeps the draw and novelty modest.

**AI Summary:** Eclectic bluegrass sets blending original compositions and traditional covers with driving banjo, fiddle, and high energy picking, delivering a cutting edge, rowdy taproom experience paired with local craft ales.

## Full Circle // Fractal Bass Ritual ft Zuvluguu, iXNéE, FloDaFunk & Illusion of Duality @ Third Room

**Date:** Saturday, January 10, 2026 at 9:00 PM

**Location:** Third Room (28801)

**Organizer:** Third Room

**Price:** Unknown

**Source:** FACEBOOK (ID: 33517670921179653)

**Tags:** Dubstep, Fractal Bass, Ritual Electronic, Asheville Djs

**Engagement:** 90 interested, 10 going

### Score

- **Total:** 21/30
- **Rarity:** 7/10
- **Uniqueness:** 9/10
- **Magnitude:** 5/10
- **Reasoning:** One-night, themed 'fractal bass ritual' with a specific lineup at Third Room — feels like a special limited show (not weekly) and earns an Asheville‑weird bonus for the ritualized/immersive concept; however the draw is regional/local club-scale rather than a major touring headliner.

**AI Summary:** Subsonic dubstep sets and fractal bass textures create a ritualized, healing soundscape at Third Room, guiding dancers through energy-clearing grooves and deep, immersive low-frequency journeys.

### Description

WHEN: Saturday January 10, 2026
DOORS: 8pm | SHOW: 9pm

## Meschiya Lake & the Speakeasy 3 | The Palm Room at Fitz and the Wolfe

**Organizer:** Fitz and the Wolfe

**Price:** Free

**Source:** AVL_TODAY (ID: 17641110)

**Tags:** Live Music, Nightlife, Sultry Swing, Cabaret Jazz, Late Night, Cocktail Lounge

### Score

- **Total:** 20/30
- **Rarity:** 6/10
- **Uniqueness:** 8/10
- **Magnitude:** 6/10
- **Reasoning:** Touring jazz vocalist in an intimate, late-night Palm Room cabaret — not a daily gig but not a once-in-a-decade one-off (similar dates listed). High “velvet noir” main-character vibe gives strong uniqueness; moderate magnitude because it’s a known touring act but playing a small cocktail-lounge venue (regional draw).

**AI Summary:** Velvet noir late-night cabaret of sultry swing and vintage jazz, with Meschiya Lake's haunting, howl-ready vocals and a trio that grooves like 1939, delivering smoky, cocktail-lounge jazz club energy.

### Description

The Palm Room goes full velvet noir with a late-night set from Meschiya Lake & the Speakeasy 3—bringing sultry swing, vintage sass, and serious jazz club energy.

With a voice that can haunt or howl and a band that grooves like it’s 1939, Meschiya Lake turns every set into a smoky, soulful, time-warped thrill ride. It's cabaret meets cocktail culture, and you're invited to stay out late and lean in close.

### Score

- **Total:** 15/30
- **Rarity:** 5/10
- **Uniqueness:** 7/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** A recurring weekly Asheville Movement Collective ecstatic-dance morning (two guided waves) — low missability but distinctive: facilitated opening circles + immersive DJ sets give strong ‘main-character’/Asheville-weird energy (+2). Free, grassroots, small-scale community draw rather than a regional touring headliner.

**AI Summary:** Rhythmic, trance-friendly ecstatic dance led by facilitator-pathway Megan Belling with DJ Esmae spinning immersive, journey-style sets; two guided morning waves include warmups and opening circles for all-levels embodied movement.

## Metalsmithing 101: The Basics Intensive Jan 10th and 11th

**Date:** Sunday, January 11, 2026 at 9:00 AM

**Location:** Ignite Jewelry Studios, 84 W Walnut St Unit A, Asheville, NC (28801)

**Organizer:** Ignite Jewelry Studios

**Price:** $499

**Source:** AVL_TODAY (ID: 17590373)

**Tags:** Crafts, Education, Metalsmithing, Beginner Friendly, Intensive Weekend, Soldering And Bezel Setting, Hands On Studio

### Score

- **Total:** 17/30
- **Rarity:** 6/10
- **Uniqueness:** 7/10
- **Magnitude:** 4/10
- **Reasoning:** A focused 2-day, 16‑hour weekend intensive — limited-run workshop (missable) teaching a niche, high-concept craft at a local professional studio; strong hands-on/creative appeal but small, local scale.

**AI Summary:** Hands-on metalsmithing intensive teaching sawing, filing, polishing, soldering, bezel setting, and texturing across 16 hours over a weekend; beginner-friendly jewelry-making in a fully equipped studio with demos and a separate materials fee.

### Description

Want to learn to make jewelry? This beginner friendly introductory metalsmithing course teaches the basics skills involved in making your own jewelry. Learn to use a variety of tools and equipment common in a jewelry studio.

This Intensive 16 hour 2 day workshop will teach many techniques including sawing, filing, polishing, soldering, bezel setting, textures, and more! $499 plus a $55 materials fee (paid separate at class)

Class Times: Saturday Jan 10th 9-5 and Sunday Jan 11th 9-5

Students will also have access to 4 Open Studio sessions to practice their skills (valid for 3 months from last day of class.) A knowledgable instructor is present during these sessions for questions and safety. Current Open Studio time: Wednesdays 10-4pm

Please know this will be a substantial amount of information over the two days and the intensity may not be ideal for everyone. Some jewelry making knowledge may be beneficial, but is not required. The course is designed to teach the skills through a series of jewelry pieces.

It is designed to teach techniques and skills rather than completing actual aesthetically pleasing pieces, but the goal is that everyone can complete 2-3 pieces of finished jewelry or more. Attending some or all Open Studios will absolutely ensure this and likely many more pieces!

\*This is the next Metalsmithing 101 offered as an intensive on a weekend format. See February for the next 4-Part Series

## New Year, New You! Intentional Creativity Workshop

**Date:** Sunday, January 11, 2026 at 9:00 AM

**Location:** Asheville Masonic Temple, 80 Broadway St., Asheville, NC (28801)

**Organizer:** Asheville Masonic Temple

**Price:** $755

**Source:** AVL_TODAY (ID: 17660994)

**Tags:** Art, Wellness, Intentional Creativity, Guided Journaling, 2.5 Day Retreat, Emotional Release, Beginner Friendly

### Score

- **Total:** 18/30
- **Rarity:** 7/10
- **Uniqueness:** 6/10
- **Magnitude:** 5/10
- **Reasoning:** A limited 2.5-day immersive New‑Year retreat (missable, small cohort) — higher rarity than a one‑night workshop. Creative + emotional-reset focus gives it solid ‘main character’ energy but isn’t wildly novel. Local, professional-scale draw at the Asheville Masonic Temple (paid retreat pricing) rather than a regional or national headline.

**AI Summary:** Two-and-a-half-day intentional creativity retreat blending guided journaling, inquiry, and expressive art to dismantle limiting beliefs, catalyze emotional release, and co-create a clear, embodied vision for the new year.

### Description

Release the Past and Embody the Future:

This isn’t just an art workshop. It’s a creative and emotional reset designed to help you start the new year with clarity, courage, and alignment.

Over the course of 2½ powerful days, we use **intentional creativity** to examine what’s been weighing us down—and to free what’s ready to rise.

How Alchemy Happens

We begin by turning inward. Through guided journaling and inquiry, you’ll name the limiting beliefs, traps, habits, and internalized pressure that have quietly shaped your past year. The things you’ve tolerated. The weight you’ve carried.

Then, you’ll paint your way into that truth. **You’ll create a full-body expression of the year you’re ready to leave behind.** And then—**you’ll destroy it.** Not in anger, but in liberation. In devotion to your next becoming.

From that cleared space, something extraordinary happens.

You begin to dream again.

We’ll then invite your unconscious desires forward—the hopes, longings, and vision that may have been buried beneath duty, fear, or survival. From this intuitive clarity, you’ll paint again—not what you *should* want, but what your soul is truly calling in.

This second painting becomes your **embodied vision board**—not a collage of pretty pictures and goals, but a powerful, energetic map of your internal and external desires. One that your nervous system can recognize and move toward. One your whole being can stand behind.

You’re here to remember what you truly want—and to make space for it, from the inside out.

Back by popular demand, 8th year running, annual event. Five star reviews.

**Date:** Sunday, January 11, 2026 at 10:00 AM

**Location:** Earth Fare's cafe, 66 Westgate Parkway = Westgate Shopping Center, Asheville, NC (28806)

**Organizer:** Earth Fare's cafe

**Price:** Free

**Source:** AVL_TODAY (ID: 15906263)

**Tags:** Community, Book Club, Atheist Meetup, Weekly Sunday, Cafe Meetup, Casual Discussion, Multi Location Group

### Score

- **Total:** 10/30
- **Rarity:** 5/10
- **Uniqueness:** 3/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Weekly, recurring casual atheist/book‑club meetup at a local cafe — easy to attend but not rare or highly novel; small, local community draw (free, informal, multi‑location group).

**AI Summary:** Casual Sunday morning conversations for secular thinkers, pairing open discussion with a biweekly book club; group also meets Wednesday evenings at local breweries and hosts monthly Hendersonville gatherings and multi-location meetups.

### Description

We hope **you** will come chat with us this coming **Sunday morning** or some time soon. More info below.

Our **Book Club** meets every two weeks at Standard Pizza on Biltmore. We also have **Wednesday evening** meetings at Boodas Brewing or Trailside in **Hendersonville** once a month. We'd like to soon add Waynesville,Weaverville and other locations; we welcome your suggestions about that.

***Sign up* in Meetup to receive emailed notices about our activities**. That website is **https://www.meetup.com › atheistsofwnc** There are no dues.

Our newly-formed group has **over 100 members already**. Typically meetings have 10-15 people attending. The conversations have been excellent. **We chat about atheism and religion**, but also about **other things that are not related to religion** at all.

In this "**community**" are people who don't believe in religion. Most don't believe in spiritualism either, while some wonder if "the universe" or something energy-related effect our lives. Others feel maybe in 100 years science will be able to explain time-without-beginning and other mysteries.

**Until further notice our Sunday morning get togethers will be 10AM - noon at the cafe at Earth Fare.** The address is 66 Westgate Pkwy, Asheville. It is a large and very good "health supermarket". You'll find the Westgate shopping center right off Patton, after crossing the bridge on 240 West. Earth Fare is at the far end of the parking lot, past the Country Inn and Suites and a CVS, UPS store and more. There is plenty of free parking.

We will be there **starting at 10AM and stay until noon** to meet any late arrivals. They have a very nice cafe that you'll find off to the left after entering the store. The grocery area also has some good deals - see https://www.earthfare.com/#about

We’ll have a sign so you can see what tables we are using. (Bring your kids if you like but we won't have any activites prepared for them.)

Note: Because we hope each member will feel it's THEIR gr...

**AI Summary:** Slow, contemplative art sessions blending guided creative prompts with quiet reflection to restore spirit and calm the mind; virtual studio mornings on 2nd and 4th Sundays for beginners and experienced makers.

### Description

Hosted by Tish Sjoberg

2nd and 4th Sundays

Now On-Line during Covid-19 Quarantine
10:00 a.m. – 12:15 p.m.
$0 - $25 (Included in our monthly pass)

Slow down and be with yourself through art making. A rich morning that feeds your spirit, rests your body, quiets your mind and helps you remember who you are!

Here we will use the arts to have a conversation with ourselves and connect to our longings and gifts. This is not about religion, yet in the inquiry you may choose to make connections to your religious beliefs.

The format: We check in as a group, we may do a little drumming, have 5 minutes of quiet/reflection/meditation/prayer/relaxation time, go create art in silence (without talking) doing our own thing and then come back together to honor what we spent our time doing.

Art making can be painting, writing, sand tray, collage, doodling, scribbling, sewing, mixed media, movement, or…. No previous art experience necessary just the willingness to follow what you are attracted to and moving slow and quiet.

- **Total:** 16/30
- **Rarity:** 6/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 5/10
- **Reasoning:** One-off museum panel on preserving Asheville’s historic churches — timely and community-specific (local preservationists/moderator) so moderately missable; solid educational/architectural interest at a professional local venue but not a major touring or wildly novel spectacle.

### Description

Stewards are now tasked with finding creative ways to preserve these architecturally, historically, and culturally important places for generations to come. Join us for a panel discussion with preservationists from the First Baptist Church, Hopkins Chapel, and the Basilica of St. Lawrence, moderated by Jessie Landl, director of the Asheville Preservation Society.

- **Rarity:** 5/10
- **Uniqueness:** 7/10

- **Reasoning:** Recurring weekly-ish cat lounge session (so not rare) but charmingly niche — adult coloring + kitties earns an Asheville-weird +2 boost to uniqueness; small local venue, low regional draw.

**AI Summary:** Soothing, low-lit cat lounge session of gentle purring and cuddles alongside 50 minutes of adult coloring from provided books and markers; a social, stress-relief evening for cat-lovers seeking calm and creative connection.

### Description

Feeling a little stressed out? Doom and gloom getting you down?

There are many scientific studies that support the understanding that petting cats and coloring relieves stress and anxiety. So why not do both?

Release your inner child by coloring with us in the cat lounge. Take 50 minutes for yourself and cuddle with the panthers, meet other cat-lovers, and color a beautiful picture of a cat from our adult coloring books!

Coloring books and markers (and of course, cats) are provided for this relaxation session. And once everyone is done with their picture, you can choose to take it home or hang it on the altar in the shop for Bastet!

Tickets are $15 per person and admission goes directly to the care of our resident panthers.

Children ages 12 and up are able to attend but it is meant to be calm and relaxing for all attendees so please keep that in mind. (We love kids but sometimes our stressors are our kids and we need time to ourselves!)

**AI Summary:** Quiet guided meditation followed by reflective journaling using Taoist poems—exploring hidden currents, underlying life-stories, and contemplative insights through prompts and group sharing in an intimate, beginner-friendly writing circle.

### Description

**We’ll explore the combination of meditation and journaling in accessing deeper levels of wisdom and understanding. We’ll set the stage with an ancient Taoist poem written by a hermit monk. The most famous of these poems is the Tao te Ching, but they wrote thousands of other poems, some equally as beautiful and mysterious. We’ll explore in our journals the hidden currents that affect the quality of our lives – the underlying stories and experiences that shape our lives without us knowing it. The layer beneath the stories we tell ourselves.**

**Bring a journal to write in and a pen.**

- **Reasoning:** One-off specialist workshop focused on bone health/frailty (more missable than weekly classes) — clinically informed therapeutic yoga with workbook gives it above-average uniqueness, but it’s a local-studio hybrid event (professional local draw, not a regional/national headliner).

**AI Summary:** Gentle therapeutic yoga sequences focused on building bone strength and preventing frailty, integrating the latest clinical research into accessible practices for all ages and fitness levels; workbook provided and available in person or virtually.

### Description

There is a building shift in the medical field that is focusing more on frailty prevention rather than treating Osteoporosis.  New research has shown measuring frailty not bone mass density should be the new standard for fracture indicators; not a diagnosis of osteoporosis. This workshop will incorporate the latest research into practice and is suitable for all age and fitness levels. A workbook will be provided.   \\n

## In-Person Connection Practice

### Score

- **Total:** 5/30
- **Rarity:** 1/10
- **Uniqueness:** 2/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Weekly recurring event - happens every week.

**AI Summary:** Facilitator-led, in-person listening and sharing exercises create a judgement-free circle where participants practice deep listening, follow a strict no-advice policy, and aim for genuine emotional connection.

### Description

A Connection Practice is a meeting to practice your skills in listening and connecting with others. No conversation topic is off limits. The only objective of the meeting is to feel a genuine sense of connection by the time it's over, and the only rule is that we promise to not give each other advice.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates.

## Psychedelic Integration Circle

**Date:** Sunday, January 11, 2026 at 3:30 PM

**Organizer:** Psychedelic Society of Asheville

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP (ID: 312585059)

**Tags:** Wellness, Support Groups, Community, Psychedelic Integration, Sharing Circle, Trauma Informed, Beginner Friendly

### Score

- **Total:** 15/30
- **Rarity:** 5/10
- **Uniqueness:** 7/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** A community, trauma-informed integration circle that feels monthly/seasonal (not a one-off) — niche psychedelic focus gives it notable ‘Asheville’ uniqueness (+weirdness bonus), but it’s a small, local wellness gathering at The Well so the draw is modest.

**AI Summary:** Gentle, trauma-informed integration circle guiding confidential sharing, inner reflection, and community connection to make meaning of psychedelic and seasonal experiences as the New Year begins.

### Description

As we cross the threshold into a New Year, we invite you to gather with us in a safe, confidential, and supportive space to share, reflect, and connect with community. This is a time to gently tend to what the holidays and seasonal shifts are stirring within, and to arrive just as you are.

Integration is a practice of intentionally slowing down, listening inward, and making meaning of our experiences so they can truly support and enrich our lives. Through integration, we can cultivate greater awareness of our thoughts, emotions, and patterns, allowing us to move through life’s changes with greater resilience, clarity, and compassion.

We are delighted to welcome Becca Marshall as our new Integration Circle facilitator. Becca is an Integrative Psychotherapist, Aligned Living Coach, Psychedelic Integration Guide, and the founder of ActivXchange. Her work supports individuals navigating major life transitions, whether entering adulthood, stepping into leadership, or guiding others through healing and transformation, with grounded presence and deep care.

Alongside Becca, there will also be psychedelic practitioners and seasoned explorers who will be available to answer questions, share wisdom, and support you as you make meaning out of your journey.

This ongoing circle is open to all whether you are simply curious, actively preparing for or integrating psychedelic experiences, or have been walking this path for some time. Our intention is to foster connection, shared wisdom, and mutual support within our ever-growing psychedelic community here in Asheville. All are welcome. Please note that this is a sober event and we do not allow attendees to use our gatherings to sell, buy, or source anything illegal. Those violating these rules will be kindly asked to leave.

- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** Volunteer-run, multigenerational English country dance with live acoustic band and caller is a charming niche/folk experience (high concept) but is a local community offering likely held regularly at the Harvest House (monthly/seasonal), so not ultra-rare and draws a hyper-local crowd.

**AI Summary:** Community English country dances with caller led waltzes and reels to live acoustic folk music at a welcoming, multigenerational community center; volunteer run evenings encourage participation, consent, and beginner friendly steps.

**Tags:** Wellness, Meditation, Spiritual, Breathwork, Somatic Breathwork, Soul Healing, Energetic Container, Beginner Friendly

### Score

- **Total:** 10/30
- **Rarity:** 3/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Local studio breathwork session at a small venue — fairly common/recurring wellness offering (missable). It’s a solid, niche spiritual experience (guided somatic breathwork) but not highly novel or a large draw; small-scale local audience.

**AI Summary:** Sacred, guided somatic breathwork using connected, cathartic breaths to move energy and evoke expanded consciousness; includes intention-setting, energetic container, guided integration, and gentle music for soul clarity and healing.

### Description

🌬️ **Breathe beyond the mind and into the wisdom of your soul.** 🌬️
Join us for a powerful **Soul Journey Breathwork** experience—a sacred space where breath becomes the bridge to clarity, healing, and deep transformation. This is not just a breathing technique—it is a journey into expanded consciousness, personal empowerment, and profound self-discovery.

**What to Expect**

Together, we will begin by setting **intentions** and establishing an **energetic container** to hold our experience. You will then be guided through a 60-minute breathwork journey, followed by a period of **gentle integration**, reflection, and grounding.

Unlike traditional breath practices designed for relaxation, this active breathwork shifts brain chemistry, silences mental noise, and allows you to access heightened states of awareness. Through rhythmic breath and an immersive soundscape, you’ll open the door to deep healing, emotional release, and soul-aligned insights.

During the experience, Marian will intuitively place crystals on and around each participant, creating a supportive energetic field to deepen your process. The stones work in harmony with the breath, amplifying release, grounding, and spiritual connection.

Come ready to breathe, release, and realign, surrounded by the crystalline energy chosen just for you.

**This Breathwork Experience Will Help You:**
✨ Step into a sacred ceremonial space for inner exploration
✨ Receive guidance, healing, and support from both seen and unseen realms
✨ Expand your relationship with yourself as **healer, healed, and whole**
✨ Align with the frequency of your **deepest YES**
✨ Clear out anything keeping you from feeling **free, wild, limitless, expansive, & true**
✨ Reconnect with the **infinite inner wellspring of wisdom**

**💰 Energy Exchange: $33**
You can pay via cash, card, check, or Venmo when you arrive.

**Price:** $24.6

**Source:** MOUNTAIN_X (ID: mx-983709)

### Score

- **Total:** 21/30
- **Rarity:** 8/10
- **Uniqueness:** 6/10
- **Magnitude:** 7/10
- **Reasoning:** Single-night touring indie-folk show at Grey Eagle — a true one-off for fans (rarity 8). Storytelling, intimate staging gives a solid 'main character' vibe but not wildly novel (unique 6). Grey Eagle is a mid-sized regional draw, so respectable magnitude (7).

**AI Summary:** Intimate indie-folk singer-songwriter set blending narrative-driven songwriting, warm acoustic arrangements, and occasional full-band textures in a mid-sized music hall evening concert with storytelling lyricism and intimate staging.

### Description

ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY FULL BAND SHOW ONDARA PRESENTS THE JET STONE CONSPIRACY Every artist's journey is a quiet revolution. For some, there comes a moment when Robert Zimmerman becomes Bob Dylan, when Reginald Dwight becomes Elton John, when David Robert Jones becomes David Bowie, when Ali Ibrahim becomes Ali Farka- it's a moment, when such an artist leaves behind the comforts of history in search of boundless expression- a moment when they metaphorically move out of their home, stepping into the unknown, and surrendering to the wild embrace of their muse. This chapter of my journey mirrors that kind of transformation. My new band, The Jet Stone Conspiracy, is the culmination of my rebirth- It's a surrender to the currents of free expression- an invitation to explore new realms of sound, movement, and poetry. The first mission of this new chapter is to come visit you with my band and share the songs from Tales of America, Tales of Isolation, and Spanish Villager No:3- all brought to life for the first time in a full-band setting. This will be my first time touring with a band- an invitation to experience with you the music that has led us to this point, in an expanded and dynamic form, and to hear the new material I'm exploring for the upcoming debut release of The Jet Stone Conspiracy. Much love,JS Born in Nairobi and reborn in America, J.S. (Jet Stone) Ondara's path has always been one of restless searching - from discovering Bob Dylan in a teenage dispute to teaching himself guitar after moving to Minneapolis alone, eventually earning a Grammy nomination for his debut album Tales of America and sharing stages with Neil Young, The Lumineers, and Lindsey Buckingham. This fall, Ondara will embark on the first full-band tour of his career. This special run is more than just a series of concerts; it's an invitation into a world rebuilt from the ground up. A chance to witness a rare moment of transformation in real time. Each night, Ondara, now performing as Jet S...

## The Will Boyd Project

**Date:** Monday, January 12, 2026 *(time not specified)*

**Location:** Little Jumbo Bar, 241 Broadway St., Asheville, NC (28801)

**Organizer:** Little Jumbo Bar

**Price:** Unknown

**Source:** AVL_TODAY (ID: 17335145)

**Tags:** Live Music, Soul Jazz, Saxophone Led, Church Inspired, Intimate Bar

### Score

- **Total:** 15/30
- **Rarity:** 5/10
- **Uniqueness:** 7/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** Local sax-led soul-jazz set at Little Jumbo — not a one-off (regular jazz nights), so moderately missable, but conceptually strong: gospel-rooted, ‘joyful noise’ sermons give it a high unique/main-character vibe. Magnitude is low–intimate bar gig with primarily local/regional draw.

**AI Summary:** Reed driven baritone and tenor sax workouts fuse gospel rooted harmonies with urgent fiery jazz improvisation, creating joyful noise sermons that channel Eddie Harris, Hank Crawford and King Curtis.

### Description

The Will Boyd Project\*\* isn't just a band-it's a spiritual reckoning delivered through reeds and rhythm, a sonic revival where the sacred traditions of the Black church collide with the revolutionary fire of jazz. Led by multi-instrumentalist and "mad sax man" Will Boyd, this ensemble transforms every performance into a joyful noise that honors the soul sax prophets-Eddie Harris, Hank Crawford, King Curtis-while pushing the movement forward with urgent, right-now energy. From baritone sax sermons to bass clarinet benedictions, Boyd channels decades of soul tradition through every note, reimagining spirituals, hymns, and freedom songs with albums like \*Freedom Soul Jazz\* and \*Soulful Noise\*. This is music that's toured Japan, shared stages with Fred Wesley and Jeff Coffin, and graced PBS documentaries-yet still feels as intimate as a Sunday morning service in a Memphis sanctuary. Joined by steady-grooving bassist Zack Page, thunderous drummer Micah Thomas, and the mountain magic of keyboardist Taylor Pierson, The Will Boyd Project proves that jazz has always been about liberation-musical, spiritual, and otherwise. Expect an evening where bebop meets the church pew, where virtuosity serves something bigger than technique, and where every song becomes a freedom song. This isn't just a performance. It's a celebration. It's a sermon. It's proof that the future sounds like freedom.

Through embodied practice, guided meditation, visualization, and affirmations, you’ll be led into a state where clarity sharpens, confidence expands, and your inner fire comes online. You’ll be introduced to the **Power Stance**, a simple yet potent embodied posture that helps anchor courage, presence, and self-trust directly into the body.

Participants may experience:

* A heightened sense of confidence and self-belief
* Increased vitality and grounded energy
* Greater clarity around purpose and personal gifts
* The courage to fully own who they are — without apology

We’ll close the experience with a gentle sharing circle, offering space to integrate, be witnessed, and connect in community.

Come as you are. Leave more fully yourself.
This is your invitation to ignite what’s already within.

### Description

You will be provided with your sanitized supplies, or feel free to bring your own colored pencils, markers, or other art supplies to express yourself during this Connection Practice Meeting.

A Connection Practice is a meeting to practice your skills in listening and connecting with others. No conversation topic is off limits. The only objective of the meeting is to feel a genuine sense of connection by the time it's over, and the only rule is that we promise to not give each other advice.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates. All connection practices are free of charge.

*We’re trying out a morning edition of the Tuesday walks for those who can’t make the 4:30 p.m. time during fall/winter.*

We’ll stroll through the bird sanctuary board walk loop then walk the two mile lake trail.

I plan for this to be a rain or shine walk unless there is a significant lightning storm.

- **Reasoning:** Weekly recurring event - happens every week.

**AI Summary:** Alchemical free-improvisation quartet performs experimental jazz and through-composed original pieces that crystallize melodic and textural quintessence in an intimate barroom setting, emphasizing exploratory, atmospheric sound.

### Description

Sanders, Boyd, Page & Hall distill the pure essence of improvisational expression, converging as alchemists of sound, transmuting musical elements into their most essential forms. This quartet embodies the philosophical concept of quintessence-the fifth element beyond earth, air, fire, and water-representing the fundamental substance from which all musical reality springs. Their original compositions crystallize the essential qualities of diverse influences, oscillating between through-composed musical themes, groove-based soul explorations, traditional jazz-influenced pieces, Americana-inspired peaceful melodicism, world music influences, free jazz adventures, and occasional forays into cacophonous noise music. Through years of improvisational study, they've learned to access that rarefied space where genres dissolve into pure creative energy. In this musical laboratory, Sanders' guitar becomes a conduit for universal vibration, Boyd's reeds channel the breath of consciousness itself, Page's bass provides the fundamental frequency of existence, while Hall's percussion creates the rhythmic heartbeat of the cosmos.

### Description

Join All Bodies Movement and Wellness in welcoming this beautiful workshop from Liz Gunn!

**Uncommon Widom: An Embodied Astro Perspective for the New Year**

The living wisdom of the astrology for 2026 is uncharted territory. We all need guides, signposts and a compass reset for what awaits each of us in this unfamiliar cosmic landscape.

No doubt you feel deeply the karmic closure of natural endings, grief, letting go and the somatic awareness of what the evolutionary collapse we are living through feels like in your body.

What if the planets and stars moving through the heavens were galactic neurotransmitters sending signals pertaining directly to YOU?

How might you respond to life, new choices, challenges and the potential for joy with greater trust?

What if the body held the codes for understanding the messages each planet transmitted like keys unlocking a doorway into a new reality?

How might you release fear and participate more fully “with your one wild and precious life?” (Mary Oliver)

Come join this discussion and hear Liz share how you might identify the embodied astrology themes showing up in your life, as it pertains to ***this moment in time***.

This will be a fun, interactive, deep experience of Liz’s journey into consciousness exploration over the last 4 decades.

Bring your questions and curiosity!

Compliments of the season! Just in time for Christmas, the short story club is doing a story about a toy. "A Real Doll" by AM Homes is a story about a boy who develops a romantic fixation for one of his sister's Barbie dolls. First published in 1990, it's a more contemporary story than we usually read here. The unconventional style and graphic depictions of certain actions will certainly provide for a lively discussion not to be missed. I know the holidays are super busy for everyone, so we'll meet to discuss this one in the New Year.

- **Reasoning:** Weekly recurring event - happens every week.

**AI Summary:** Sixty-minute timed writing sprints in a low-key coffeehouse atmosphere, with quick intros and communal accountability for novels, poems, lyrics, resumes, and work reports; arrive early to claim a seat and focus.

### Description

Shut Up & Write!

**Here's how it works.** Show up at or before 6:00. At 6:00, we do some quick introductions. Afterward, for a full 60 minutes (I'll set a timer!) we are heads-down writing. Writing what? A novel? You bet. Some poetry? Sure. Song lyrics? Your resume? That report you need to get to your boss before 8 AM or you'll *need* *to write* that resume? All of the above and more. Just shut up and write.

Surrounding ourselves with other writers who are busy putting words onto page (physical or virtual) keeps us all accountable and focused.

When the timer goes off, we'll check-in with each other and see how it went. Afterward, feel free to stay to chat and get to know your fellow writers, or keep writing, or take off.

Socializing is optional and will happen after (or briefly before) the focused writing. This is a safe space to work on your craft. No one will read or critique your writing.

For more information about our events, visit [https://shutupwrite.com](https://shutupwrite.com).

**What to Expect**

* Roughly 15 minutes of introductions
* 60 minutes of focused writing (somebody set a timer)!
* Afterward, optional socializing

**Being late is okay:** Just show up and get settled, then check in with the host after the session. (Look for the person with the Shut Up & Write sign).

**What Should I Bring?**

* Whatever you need to be able to write!
* Earbuds/earplugs if you want to block ambient noise.

**Other Important Details:**

HOSTS: This is a multi-host event, so most of the time there will be a host present. If we are unlucky and no host can attend, please find each other and self-organize. Pay attention to the event chat and comments to see who is available.

WI-FI: Yes!

PARKING: Street parking in metered spots is free after 6pm. Closest municipal garages ($2/hour) are Wall St. & Coxe Street/Sears Alley.

### Score

- **Total:** 13/30
- **Rarity:** 6/10
- **Uniqueness:** 3/10
- **Magnitude:** 4/10
- **Reasoning:** A limited 5-week beginner series (so somewhat missable) at a local studio — useful but a standard offering in Asheville yoga scene, modest local-studio draw rather than a regional headliner.

**AI Summary:** Slow 75-minute yoga sessions at a beginner's pace emphasizing foundational alignment, breath, and mindful movement; five-week series builds confidence and practical skills to join all-level studio classes.

### Description

This 5-week series is for absolute beginners as well as anyone who wants to cultivate a beginner’s mind. **We will move at a beginner’s pace, with no yogi left behind.** If you’ve been thinking about practicing yoga and want to develop a movement practice that is more than just exercise, this is your invitation to dive in and **start yoga now**. Each 75-min class covers the basics to give students the confidence and knowledge to join any of our all-level classes. 

Students explore a variety of poses and series, from standing to supine, twists, forward bends and backbends, and even beginning inversions. You’ll gain more strength and flexibility while alleviating pain, and learn how to manage stress more effectively with simple breathing practices and Heartfull® Meditation techniques. 

**And because sometimes doing new things by yourself can be intimidating, we’ve got a special offer for two who sign up together.** For any two folks who want to come to class together (friends, spouses, siblings, partners) we’ve got a special deal of two for $145. If you’d like to sign up for yourself and another student, simply purchase the **Start Yoga Now for 2** pass and then send us an email with the name of the other student and we’ll take care of registration for them.

**Letitia** has been teaching yoga for almost 20 years, and some of her favorite students to work with are total beginners stepping on to the mat for the first time. She loves demystifying both yoga poses and yoga philosophy by deconstructing complex concepts and movements into simple, accessible pieces. When you study with Letitia, you learn the point of the poses, the basic actions of the poses, and how to practice the pose for your body in a way that is effective while encouraging growth and change.

*Please note: While this series is designed for beginners, it is not suitable for those recovering from recent surgeries (such as knee replacement or rotator cuff repair), or for students who rely on mobility ai...

- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** A one-evening, free pizza-parlor reading/discussion of a Nobel-winning political novel — culturally rich and intimate but a common-format book-club event at a small local venue, so moderately missable and low-scale.

**AI Summary:** Intimate evening reading and discussion of Mario Vargas Llosa’s Feast of the Goat, a Nobel-winning political novel about Trujillo’s fall and Urania Cabral’s haunted return, held in a casual pizza-parlor setting.

### Description

WINNER OF THE NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE

In The Feast of the Goat, this 'masterpiece of Latin American and world literature, and one of the finest political novels ever written' (Bookforum), Mario Vargas Llosa recounts the end of a regime and the birth of a terrible democracy, giving voice to the historical Trujillo and the victims, both innocent and complicit, drawn into his deadly orbit.

Haunted all her life by feelings of terror and emptiness, forty-nine-year-old Urania Cabral returns to her native Dominican Republic - and finds herself reliving the events of l961, when the capital was still called Trujillo City and one old man terrorized a nation of three million. Rafael Trujillo, the depraved ailing dictator whom Dominicans call the Goat, controls his inner circle with a combination of violence and blackmail. In Trujillo's gaudy palace, treachery and cowardice have become a way of life. But Trujillo's grasp is slipping. There is a conspiracy against him, and a Machiavellian revolution already underway that will have bloody consequences of its ow

**Organizer:** Awakening Asheville

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP (ID: 312400067)

**Tags:** Wellness, Spiritual, Meditation, Education, Light Language, Sound Healing, Vocal Toning, Nervous System Regulation, Supine Integration

### Score

- **Total:** 12/30
- **Rarity:** 2/10
- **Uniqueness:** 8/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Niche, recurring wellness offering at a small local studio (many similar sessions listed), so it's easily missable (weekly/monthly). High ‘Main Character’ energy due to the unusual ‘light language’ vocal work and the local 'Asheville weird' vibe (+2). Low draw — intimate/local venue and audience rather than a regional or national headliner.

**AI Summary:** Resonant vocal toning and guided sound exercises designed to activate light language, clear energetic blockages, and soothe the nervous system; followed by a supine sound-and-energy healing integration to embody the shifts.

### Description

During our time we will explore vocal exercises and sounds to activate your light language. The vocal exercises are great for clearing and moving energy throughout your body, while easing your nervous system. This creates space to allow more energetic flow through your whole being.

Following this interactive session, you then will lay down and receive sound and energy healing to integrate your process. We all have the ability to access light language and if you have been called or intrigued, please reach out!

This is a non-judgement, safe container for free expression and play.

When: Tuesday, January 13th
Time: 6:30pm-8pm
Sliding Scale: $25-40

**Lauren’s Bio:**

As a certified Reiki Master, Advanced IET Practitioner, and Munay‑Ki Shamanic Practitioner, I blend deep knowledge of energetic systems with intuitive guidance.

My journey into healing led me to train in sound healing, vocal therapy, Ayurveda, and natural medicines—all central to my transformative approach. For nearly a decade, I’ve been channeling light language, a vibrational transmission that transcends words to spark profound energetic shifts.

I hold private sessions and lead group gatherings, always cultivating a safe, nurturing environment where deep healing and self‑discovery can unfold. I believe true healing occurs when we reconnect with our essence, release what no longer serves us, and step into our highest potential.

My work supports this process—facilitating energetic realignment, spiritual awakening, and personal growth. My mission is to hold space for transformation, empowering each person to reclaim their inner light and walk a path of wholeness.

- **Reasoning:** Weekly recurring event - happens every week.

**AI Summary:** Quartet distills improvisational jazz into elemental, quintessence driven original compositions that oscillate between through composed structures and free improvisation, unfolding as attentive, exploratory interplay in an intimate cocktail lounge atmosphere.

### Description

Sanders, Boyd, Page & Hall distill the pure essence of improvisational expression, converging as alchemists of sound, transmuting musical elements into their most essential forms. This quartet embodies the philosophical concept of quintessence—the fifth element beyond earth, air, fire, and water—representing the fundamental substance from which all musical reality springs. Their original compositions crystallize the essential qualities of diverse influences, oscillating between through-composed musical themes, groove-based soul explorations, traditional jazz-influenced pieces, Americana-inspired peaceful melodicism, world music influences, free jazz adventures, and occasional forays into cacophonous noise music. Through years of improvisational study, they've learned to access that rarefied space where genres dissolve into pure creative energy. In this musical laboratory, Sanders' guitar becomes a conduit for universal vibration, Boyd's reeds channel the breath of consciousness itself, Page's bass provides the fundamental frequency of existence, while Hall's percussion creates the rhythmic heartbeat of the cosmos. Will Boyd - Sax, Flute, Clarinet, EWI Zack Page - Acoustic & Electric Bass Alan Hall - Drums Jay Sanders - Guitar and Effects Every Monday and Tuesday, Little Jumbo brings live jazz to your ears. littlejumbobar.com “Simply put, Little Jumbo should be at the top of your list of places for cocktails in Asheville. The drinks and service are both top-notch, and the atmosphere is reminiscent of a relaxed speakeasy, without a trace of the pretention that can sometimes be found in such places.” ~ The SmokyMountains.com Local Expert Team

### Description

A Connection Practice is a meeting to practice your skills in listening and connecting with others. No conversation topic is off limits. The only objective of the meeting is to feel a genuine sense of connection by the time it's over, and the only rule is that we promise to not give each other advice.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates.

### Score

- **Total:** 15/30
- **Rarity:** 4/10
- **Uniqueness:** 6/10
- **Magnitude:** 5/10
- **Reasoning:** Monthly, recurring meetup so not super rare (4). The AI+beer, beginner-friendly presentations and discussions give it a fun, slightly 'main character' angle in AVL’s tech scene (unique 6). Held at One World West — an established local coworking/taproom so it's a solid local professional draw rather than a regional headliner (magnitude 5).

**AI Summary:** Practical, beginner-friendly explorations of AI integration for nontechnical professionals—short presentations and group discussions on marketing, content creation, and ethics while enjoying craft brews in a relaxed coworking taproom setting.

### Description

**Guided Interactive Event to Help Shape your 2026!**
A 60-minute guided lab where you will use AI alongside peers to design a realistic, personal goal for the year ahead. Choose a focus area, work with AI as a collaborative partner, and pressure-test your thinking with others. Leave with clarity, momentum, and a plan you can actually use.

Bring your own laptop and make sure to have an AI account (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini)

- **Total:** 14/30
- **Rarity:** 6/10

## Read 2 Succeed Volunteer Tutor Training

**Date:** Wednesday, January 14, 2026 at 6:00 PM

**Location:** Asheville, NC (28806)

**Organizer:** AVL Today

**Price:** Free

**Source:** AVL_TODAY (ID: 17753054)

### Score

- **Total:** 11/30
- **Rarity:** 5/10
- **Uniqueness:** 3/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** Free, structured volunteer tutor training is important but not a one-off — typically offered periodically (monthly/seasonal). It's community-focused and equity-centered (valuable but not novelty entertainment), and it draws a local volunteer/staff audience rather than regional or national crowds.

**AI Summary:** Structured volunteer tutor training to support K-5 students' reading confidence across Asheville and Buncombe County, emphasizing equity for Black and Brown learners. Connects volunteers with schools and families to foster joyful, affirming literacy.

### Description

Become a Volunteer Reading Tutor with Read 2 Succeed

At Read 2 Succeed \(R2S\), we believe all children are capable, brilliant, and worthy of an education that affirms their full potential. We partner with families, schools, and volunteers to support K-5 students across Asheville and Buncombe County in becoming confident, joyful readers.

Public schools-especially those serving Black and Brown students-are under-resourced and impacted by systems that weren’t built for equity. That’s why we’re looking for community members ready to show up with consistency, humility, and respect for the hard work students are already doing to learn to read.

We’re recruiting volunteer reading tutors to commit to one student for the full school year, meeting with them twice a week during or after school. Our tutors are trained, supported, and deeply connected to a network of people committed to literacy justice and educational equity in our community.

Learn more and complete the volunteer tutor application online at  https://www.r2sasheville.org/reading-tutor.html

NOTE: All volunteer reading tutors are required to complete six hours of training across three days \(Wednesdays, Jan. 14th, 21st, and 28th from 6 PM - 8 PM on Zoom\)

All trainings take place on Zoom. You will receive the meeting link via email after registering.

### Score

- **Total:** 13/30
- **Rarity:** 3/10
- **Uniqueness:** 7/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** A single-night shamanic drumming circle is niche and has strong 'Asheville weird' appeal (hence higher uniqueness), but similar spiritual/meditation circles are common locally so it isn’t very rare. Small community venue (The Well) and modest $20 ticket keep magnitude low — a local, peer-led experiential offering rather than a major draw.

**AI Summary:** Pulsating live drumming guides a trance-inducing shamanic journey to alter brain waves, access spirit guidance, and mark seasonal rites in a supportive community circle for all experience levels.

### Description

Join our community & practice-using live drumming to alter brain waves, connect to seasonal celebrations, and integrate the NEW YOU!

Why Journey? Well, for one, it’s MAGIC! Learning to use and strengthen the “multidimensional muscle” is helpful across life: assisting in meditative practices; getting clarity and guidance more quickly and easily; grounding in the reminder that we are a part of a MASSIVE MULTIVERSE of helpful Spirits and Beings, in-person community, and the largeness of Self. ✨

Exploring our consciousness and fostering relationships with our guides in the lower world, upper world, and middle worlds. Traveling in the tradition of Core Shamanism via drum beat.

Bring a blanket and eye pillow for journeying, a journal to capture insights, and a water bottle. You're welcome to bring a drum or any portable instrument that calls to you and a crystal to charge/clear on the altar and/or journey with. We jam and sing to the Earth from 6:15pm, and then start as promptly at 6:30 as possible.

Join us in-person only at The Well in West Asheville.

We also tend to enjoy a closing ceremony at the end with a little group magic! Sometimes that takes us a little bit over time so we may end around 8:45-9ish. Participation is optional if you need to skeedattle sooner!

Snacks are provided for grounding and fellowship afterwards.

*Beginners and advancing practitioners alike are welcome to this Circle!*

Cost: $20-30

**We will not hold circle if there are fewer than four attendees**. Please [let me know](mailto:randi.janelle@gmail.com) if you are intending to attend, and I can keep you in the loop you in case of cancellation.

Self-Care and Community of Practice Led by Black Facilitators, for the Black Community.

About this Event
"Caring for myself is not self - indulgence; it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare." Audre Lorde

This is an invitation specifically for persons who identify as Black or African American and are overwhelmed with the injustice of the world and are ready to create space in their lives for self-care as we fight for justice for all! (We offer a parallel session for Allies to connect, learn and find support in their work to dismantle racism at allies.eventbrite.com)

We believe Black people deserve a space to relax, reassess, and realign ourselves.

We are a collective of Black stress-management & wellness instructors inspired by human values.

We are here to facilitate your journey of trauma-relief and stress-management.

Imagine how much more energy you will have and how much more powerful you will be when you cut your stress levels in half!

And it can be done in just a few minutes using nothing but your own breath...

Over the last 10 years, we've taught over 100,000 people to do just that.
The key is that your breath is directly linked to your emotions.

This 1-Hour Restorative Session Includes:
-Open, safe space for sharing and self-care for Black people
-Facilitated discussion
-Breath work and meditation

Led by Black facilitators, certified in stress and trauma relief.
Unleash the Hidden Healing Power of the Breath

The view of the world in Vajrayana is that innate wisdom and potential for awakening is always present. Through Vajrayana meditation practices and Buddhist philosophy, we train to see the world with a “pure view,” an openness to connect with what is good, uplifted, the positive potential.

## Celebrate Dolly Parton's Birthday & Round Up for the RADA Foundation

**Date:** Thursday, January 15, 2026 at 10:00 AM

**Location:** Mast General Store Asheville, 15 Biltmore Ave, Asheville, NC (28801)

**Price:** Free

### Score

- **Total:** 13/30
- **Rarity:** 6/10
- **Uniqueness:** 4/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** One-week, themed in-store fundraising event (Jan 12–18) — limited-time but not rare. Charming Dolly-birthday angle adds some flair but it's a standard retail round-up with no major production or touring talent. Local retail venue draws shoppers and tourists, so modest community impact.

**AI Summary:** In-store round-up converts customer purchases into donations for the River Arts District, pairing birthday-week community fundraising with local arts programming and educational grants Jan 12–18 at the Asheville Mast General Store.

### Description

Dolly Parton is an American icon who is renowned for decades of unforgettable performances on stage, screen, and in studio. No matter the heights she’s reached, Dolly always remembers her roots.

Her legendary career proves that every artist’s journey begins with the resources, training, and encouragement they receive at home. In honor of Dolly’s birthday, Mast General Store will RoundUP for community arts-based organizations January 12-18. The Asheville store is rounding UP for the River Arts District Artists Foundation!

Your choice to RoundUP your purchases to the nearest dollar supports our partnering local groups who enrich and inspire us, tell stories that connect us and deepen our sense of cultural identity, and, perhaps even, enable the next generation’s “Dolly” to make her way to the bigtime.

Thank you in advance for your generosity and belief in the vibrancy of community arts, and Happy Birthday, Dolly!

### Score

- **Total:** 12/30
- **Rarity:** 5/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Recurring meetup-style creativity journaling + meditation session (multiple similar dates listed) so not urgent (rarity 5). Niche, artist-focused format gives moderate 'main-character' appeal but it's a common workshop type (unique 5). Small, local studio meetup for a handful of participants — hyper-local draw (magnitude 2).

**AI Summary:** Gentle guided journaling and meditation practices for songwriters and artists to drop beneath the busy surface mind, listen for the shy inner voice, and nurture emergent melodies and lyrics in a small group forum.

### Description

* **We’ll explore the use of journaling and meditation in creative work. We’ll nurture the song within and see what that shy inner voice wants to tell us. It is about listening first – sensing what wants to become. This is a forum where artists can drop beneath the busy surface mind and listen for what's trying to emerge.**

**There are moments in our lives, there are moments in a day, when we seem to see beyond the usual--become clairvoyant. We reach then into reality. Such are the moments of our greatest happiness. Such are the moments of our greatest vision....At such times there is a song going on within us, a song to which we listen. It fills us with surprise. We marvel at it. We would continue to hear it. But few are capable of holding themselves in the state of listening to their song. Intellectuality steps in and as the song within us is of the utmost sensitiveness, it retires in the presence of the cold, material intellect. It is aristocratic and will not associate itself with the commonplace--and we fall back and become our ordinary selves. Yet we live in the memory of these songs which in moments of intellectual inadvertence have been possible to us. They are the pinnacles of our experience and it is the desire to express these intimate sensations, this song from within, which motivates the masters of all art.**

**Organizer:** Awakening Asheville

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP (ID: 312487851)

**Tags:** Spiritual, Education, Evolutionary Astrology, Pluto In Aquarius, Uranus In Gemini, Interactive Workshop, Donations Suggested

### Score

- **Total:** 16/30
- **Rarity:** 5/10
- **Uniqueness:** 8/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** Niche, timely one-off workshop (Jan 15) tied to a specific Jan 20–26 activation window — seasonal rather than weekly but not a rare headline. High 'Asheville weird' and specialized astrology/interactive chart focus (plus host David Heiss) boosts uniqueness. Small local spiritual studio (Energetic Experiences) keeps magnitude low.

**AI Summary:** Deep evolutionary astrology workshop exploring Pluto in Aquarius, Uranus in Gemini, and shifting lunar nodes; chart-focused, interactive discussions and practical timing tools aligned with the Jan 20–26 activation window, led by David Heiss.

### Description

Embark on a celestial journey and join us for an enchanting Astrology Workshop with David Heiss (Evolutionary Astrologer).

**💫Donations Gratefully Accepted💫**

This workshop it timed for the 1st big Activation during Jan 20 -26

**Astrology Workshop: The Great Turning of 2025–2026**
The skies of 2025 and 2026 hum with destiny—a slow, shimmering call from the future.Pluto thunders through Aquarius,Uranus prepares to scatter new ideas on Gemini winds,and the Nodes continue reshaping the karmic tides of Earth.But 2026 carries its own unmistakable pulse—a year of dissolution, revelation, and sacred reorientation.

From an **evolutionary astrology** perspective,2026 is a threshold year.
Saturn approaches Neptune in Aries,softening old defenses and dissolving identities that no longer fit the soul’s becoming. It is a time when ego structures thin like veils,revealing the deeper courage your soul has been cultivating through lifetimes. In Aries, this conjunction asks: *What new trail is your soul ready to walk—and what illusions must fall away for you to take the first step?*

Pluto’s continuing activation of Aquarius pushes us further into collective evolution—liberating, destabilizing, awakening. It is the storm and the spark,the breakdown of outdated systems and the birth of unimagined pathways of connection.

Uranus shifting toward Gemini opens neural and spiritual pathways,rewiring how we think, speak, and perceive truth, It is the messenger of the future, whispering through intuition, dream, and synchronicity.

In this workshop, we will explore these transits not as outer-world events, but as soul-initiations: invitations to release karmic imprints, awaken latent gifts, and step into a more authentic expression of purpose.

Come feel the mythic rhythm of these years—the unraveling, the ignition, the rising. Discover how your chart becomes a compass guiding you through the great evolutionary gateways of 2025–2026.
A journey for the brave, the curious, and all those...

### Score

- **Total:** 13/30
- **Rarity:** 3/10
- **Uniqueness:** 7/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** Low-urgency, likely recurring casual meetup (easy to miss but not rare).

**AI Summary:** Cozy, moody underground cocktail den pouring classy craft cocktails in a speakeasy atmosphere beneath Haywood Road. Casual meetup vibe ideal for digital nomads and night owls seeking intimate, mysterious bar ambience.

### Description

**Classy Cocktails at The Low Down 🍸✨**
**Thursday, January 15**
**6:30 – 8:30 pm**
**723 Haywood Road, Unit 1, Asheville, NC**

Downstairs. Literally. Follow the golden arrow. 👀⬇️

You are invited to another round of Classy Cocktails, this time at one of West Asheville’s best kept secrets, The Low Down.

This spot is a hidden, underground cocktail den tucked beneath Bebop Bottle Shop and The Hop Ice Cream. Cozy. Moody. A little mysterious. The kind of place you feel cool just walking into. Think speakeasy vibes, wood interiors, art deco meets occult details, eye motifs watching over your cocktail choices, and a room that practically whispers stay awhile. 🖤✨

What you’re in for 🍹
• Seriously good craft cocktails and mocktails made by talented mixologists who know what they’re doing
• A relaxed, intimate atmosphere that makes conversation easy and laughs louder
• Shuffleboard for the casually competitive types 🎯
• A stylish crowd, good energy, and zero pressure to network or perform
• That fun feeling of discovering a place you’ll definitely come back to

This is not a business event.
This is not a pitch fest.
This is a show up, grab a drink, mingle, and make a new friend kind of thing. 😎

Come solo or bring a friend. You’ll recognize us by the smiling faces, good vibes, and people saying things like “How have I never been here before?”

Classy cocktails. Underground vibes. West Asheville energy.
You in? 🍸🔥

**\*\*\* We are limited to only 40 people for this one. So register early.**
**And, please DO NOT register for this event if you are not 100% absolutely going to attend.**

## Inquiry in Motion: Open Floor Movement Class Series

**Date:** Thursday, January 15, 2026 at 6:30 PM

**Location:** Asia House, 119 Coxe Ave, Asheville, NC (28801)

**Organizer:** Asia House

**Price:** $130

**Source:** AVL_TODAY (ID: 13130103)

**Tags:** Dance, Education, Open Floor, Somatic Movement, Six Week Series, Body Awareness, Preregistration Required

### Score

- **Total:** 17/30
- **Rarity:** 6/10
- **Uniqueness:** 7/10
- **Magnitude:** 4/10
- **Reasoning:** Six-week committed series = limited-run (missable). Somatic Open Floor is a niche, experiential offering (plus an 'Asheville' somatic/creative vibe) boosting uniqueness. Small community venue and local instructor-led format gives it modest, professional-local draw.

**AI Summary:** Slow, exploratory Open Floor practice emphasizing somatic movement and body awareness across a committed six-week group, each session exploring a distinct theme to integrate movement insights into daily life.

### Description

**The series is 6 weeks of dancing with the same group of people. Each week we will explore a different theme, which we will be able to integrate into our everyday lives.**

**Pre-registration is required.**

**Visit the following link to find out the dates of the next series: http://www.staceybutcher.com/inquiry-in-motion-committed-series-in-asheville.html**

Join us as we embark on a dynamic moving exploration of the truth that resides in our own body. Through the Open Floor movement/dance practice, Somatic Experiencing principles, and mindful inquiry, we will journey below the stories about who we are and who we should be. Together we will strengthen our skills to listen, track and follow the innate wisdom of our own body, discovering how it speaks to us through movement.

Open Floor is a healing movement meditation practice and lively dance inquiry. The emphasis is to awaken our sensate experience, emotional intelligence, relational skills, and mindful awareness. From our practice on the dance floor, you will develop greater trust in your body's natural intelligence that will enable you to live with more awareness, vitality and joy.

Advantages of dancing with a committed group: • We meet with the same group each week. • We develop a safe container in which we can dive deeper together over time. • We develop trust in our community.

\~~~~~~

“WOW! Stacey's Open Floor Movement dance workshops are my favorite thing in life right now! She hosts a closed cohort that meets for 5 or 6 weeks at a time. Participants get to know one another through the language of dance, which creates intimacy, community, and a sense of safety that allows for a deeper degree of vulnerability. There's true healing here! Stacey also brings her depth of somatic knowledge into the curated workshops that feel to be a melding between somatic experiencing, yoga, and ceremony. Of all the conscious dance in Asheville, what Stacey has created is truly unique, special, intentional, and EXACTLY the ...

## Quantum Energy Healing & Transformation: Group Session w/ Meg

**Date:** Thursday, January 15, 2026 at 7:00 PM

**Location:** The Well, 3 Louisiana Avenue, Asheville (28806)

**Organizer:** Meg

**Price:** $20

**Source:** MOUNTAIN_X (ID: mx-981749)

**Tags:** Spiritual, Wellness, Meditation, Quantum Energy, Group Healing, Trauma Release, Guided Visualization, Embodiment Practice

### Score

- **Total:** 10/30
- **Rarity:** 3/10
- **Uniqueness:** 4/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** Regular small-group wellness offering at a local studio (multiple similar dates listed), so fairly missable; a solid, low‑key spiritual/healing experience rather than a novel or high‑caliber draw. Small venue and independent facilitator keep magnitude low; uniqueness is modest (typical meditation/healing circle).

**AI Summary:** Guided quantum-energy group session using collective intention and visualization to clear trauma imprints, release limiting patterns, and embody more light in a gentle, somatic-informed container.

### Description

A group session focusing on connecting in the quantum field to release limitations, clear trauma imprints, and embody more light.

## Slice Standup Comedy Pageant Winter Finale

**Location:** Pulp, 103 Hilliard Avenue (Downstairs in the Orange Peel building), Asheville, NC (28806)

### Score

- **Total:** 20/30

The pageant/contest format gives it higher 'main character' energy (plus local flavor), and being in The Orange Peel’s PULP basement brings it above a neighborhood show with a solid regional draw and frequent sell-outs.

## Ruston Kelly – Pale, Through the Window Tour

**Date:** Thursday, January 15, 2026 at 8:00 PM

**Price:** $32

**Source:** MOUNTAIN_X (ID: mx-958507)

**Tags:** Alt Country, Singer Songwriter, Folk Rock, Intimate Club Show, Confessional Lyrics

### Score

- **Total:** 21/30
- **Rarity:** 8/10
- **Uniqueness:** 6/10
- **Magnitude:** 7/10
- **Reasoning:** Ruston Kelly is a touring singer‑songwriter playing a single night at the Grey Eagle (a notable regional venue) — fairly missable but a one‑off date (rarity 8). The show has solid 'main character' alt‑country/folk appeal and intimate, confessional energy but isn’t ultra‑novel (unique 6). Playing the Grey Eagle and drawing a regional audience gives it mid‑high draw (magnitude 7). Total fits a major touring club show in Asheville.

**AI Summary:** Soulful alt-country and folk-rock anchored by acoustic guitar and atmospheric electric textures, delivering candid, confessional lyricism. Intimate, melancholic sets blend stripped solo passages with full-band swells for an emotionally raw evening.

### Description

ALL AGESSTANDING ROOM ONLY RUSTON KELLY Since making his debut with 2018's Dying Star, Ruston Kelly has built a catalog of songs that search for transcendence in the most devastating and demanding of experiences: addiction, the strenuous work of self-evolution, the fallout of broken relationships. But in the writing of his latest album, the South Carolina-born artist found himself in unfamiliar emotional territory-a state of sustained joy and inner peace, brought on by a spiritual breakthrough and the dawning of a new love. Brimming with the grit and depth that's always defined his output, Pale, Through the Window ultimately affirms Kelly as one of modern music's most astute observers of the human heart and spirit. The follow-up to The Weakness-a 2023 release that earned major acclaim from the likes of Rolling Stone, The New York Times, NPR and led to his appearance on "Late Night with Seth Meyers"-Pale, Through the Window finds Kelly reuniting with his longtime collaborator Jarrad K, who also helmed production on Dying Star and 2020's Shape & Destroy. The first body of work he's recorded with his longtime touring band, the album centers on a singular sonic palette that often merges synth with pedal-steel guitar while fully embracing Kelly's ardent love of classic pop-punk and emo-ultimately bringing a raw and potent energy to his soul-searching songwriting. Over the course of Pale, Through the Window's 13 songs, Kelly offers up everything from the somber rumination of the LP's title track and the rueful longing of "Twisted Root" (an intimate look at his history with addiction) to the radiant open-heartedness of love songs like "Waiting to Love You" and "Wayside" (a euphoric but unvarnished portrait of love against the backdrop of a world in flames). And in sharing such an all-embracing account of his journey to acceptance and peace, he aspires to provide others with the courage to persevere through their own personal chaos. "If someone's struggling with doubt or ho...

## In-Person Connection Practice Meeting

**Date:** Friday, January 16, 2026 at 1:00 PM

**Location:** SeekHealing, 50 S French Broad Ave #300, Asheville, NC (28806)

**Organizer:** SeekHealing Asheville

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP (ID: 312598975)

**Tags:** Wellness, Community, Facilitated Listening Practice, No Advice Rule, Interpersonal Skill Building, Emotional Connection, Healing Center

### Score

- **Total:** 5/30
- **Rarity:** 1/10
- **Uniqueness:** 2/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Weekly recurring event - happens every week.

**AI Summary:** Facilitator-led, time‑managed listening exercises that build deep interpersonal skills and emotional closeness, practiced in a healing-center setting with a strict no-advice rule; a rotating facilitator and 'Space Owl' steward guide sessions.

### Description

A Connection Practice is a meeting to practice your skills in listening and connecting with others. No conversation topic is off limits. The only objective of the meeting is to feel a genuine sense of connection by the time it's over, and the only rule is that we promise to not give each other advice.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates.

### Score

- **Total:** 15/30
- **Rarity:** 4/10
- **Uniqueness:** 6/10
- **Magnitude:** 5/10
- **Reasoning:** Local, small-group metalsmithing workshop — not a one-off (similar classes are regularly offered), so moderately missable. Beginner-friendly, hands-on mountain-themed jewelry gives it local 'Asheville' flair (+unique), while the scale is a professional small-studio class rather than a regional/headliner event.

**AI Summary:** Hands-on evening workshop crafting mountain-inspired mixed-metal bracelets, teaching basic soldering, metal texturing, and finishing techniques in a small studio setting; ideal for beginners and intermediate makers seeking wearable artisan jewelry skills.

**AI Summary:** Studio workshop practicing linear and atmospheric perspective for drawing and painting with step by step demos and hands on exercises. Trackside Studios hosts focused work on vanishing points, depth, and composition.

## Sound Bath & Gong Meditation with David Heiss

**Date:** Friday, January 16, 2026 at 6:00 PM

- **Rarity:** 1/10
- **Uniqueness:** 2/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Weekly recurring event - happens every week.

**AI Summary:** Deep resonant crystal gong layers and immersive gongs guide a restorative sound bath to reset the nervous system, preceded by a brief astrology overview led by master gong player David Heiss.

### Description

Join us for a relaxing sound bath meditation led by David Heiss, Master gong player and sound healing musician. David has been playing gongs and facilitating sound healing journeys since 2012. You can learn more about his work at [​https://starsounds.love](https://www.starsounds.love/)

Leave the week's stress behind as you relax and reset your nervous system with this special clearing crystal gong bath.

We will begin with a brief overview of the current astrology aspects in our sky. Then enjoy a powerful yet relaxing 45 min. gong meditation followed by an integration.

When the gong sings, you listen. You listen listens with every cell of your body. You hear it and feel it. You begin to sense more. The obscure sounds leave your brain guessing and eventually surrenders to the soundwave as you begin to relax, feel and heal. The vibrational frequencies can awaken stagnant energy. The experience is like a personal dream. There are moments during a gong meditation where the subconscious can become more conscious, where illumination and insight follows.

Suggested donations for this event are $20-40. Donations can be made at the event via cash or Venmo.

Please bring any comfort items you may desire: blankets, pillows, bolsters, eye mask, etc. We do not yet have enough community items for everyone.

* The event is from 6 - 7:30 p.m.

Friday January 16th
Evening Dance Wave 7:00 pm \- 9:00 pm \| Warmup 7pm \| Opening Circle 7:30 pm
Guest DJ Fiddlehead\, Clay Savely \| Supporting Facilitator Kris Hostikka

Intention: “El Libro de La Selva”

Fiddlehead invites you to embark on a fresh new Quest into the magic and wonder of the beloved jungles of our hearts, minds and bodies. As our beautiful deciduous rainforests of Appalachia lay cold and dormant beneath the surface and mycelium, we remember the inner warmth of our heart space and the many cozy fires we tend as a powerful community. In this collective dance of unity and hope, we honour all of the magical beings, animals and plants around the world in all of the ecosystems that need our support. As we dance through this cascading wave of change, we find joy and bliss in the challenges and hurdles of our life, and send love to all those in need. We dance together to release, renew and cleanse under the healing waterfalls of eternity and all of the sacred rainforests around El Mundo. Our life continues to be an open book, and what we write next will determine the course of the future for the next seven generations.

### Score

- **Total:** 21/30
- **Rarity:** 8/10
- **Uniqueness:** 7/10
- **Magnitude:** 6/10
- **Reasoning:** A one-night touring stop by a veteran Canadian roots/alt-country songwriter — fairly missable (true one-off) and high on niche, narrative-driven appeal; not wildly 'Asheville-weird' but likely a mid-sized regional draw in an intimate venue.

**AI Summary:** Seasoned Canadian singer-songwriter delivering narrative-driven roots and alt country songs with wry storytelling and earthy melodies, distilled from five decades of career; an intimate, lyric-focused concert for Americana fans.

### Description

ALL AGES SEATED SHOW FRED EAGLESMITH Fred Eaglesmith, the Canadian singer-songwriter and roots music icon, has spent over five decades carving out a singular path in the music world. Known for his raw, storytelling lyrics, gravelly voice, and unapologetic independence, Eaglesmith has become a cult hero to fans of Americana, folk, and country music. Born in rural Ontario in 1957, he ran away from home at 15, hopping freight trains and living a nomadic life that would later fuel the vivid, working-class narratives in his songs. With a career spanning more than 25 albums, Eaglesmith has earned a reputation as a prolific and uncompromising artist. His songs, often laced with wit, heartbreak, and a touch of rebellion, have been covered by legends like Toby Keith, Alan Jackson, Miranda Lambert and countless more. Tracks like "Time to Get a Gun" and "Freight Train" have become anthems for the disenfranchised, while his live performances- equal parts rock show and revival meeting- have cemented his status as a must-see act. Eaglesmith, along with his multi-instrumental wife, Tif Ginn, have teamed up with a new band, The Velvet Frogs, injecting fresh energy into their timeless sound. The Velvet Frogs bring a dynamic, genre-blurring edge to Eaglesmith's music, blending his signature rootsy grit with psychedelic undertones and a dash of rock 'n' roll swagger. Together, they're reimagining his classic tunes and introducing new material that proves Eaglesmith is as vital and inventive as ever. No longer a road warrior, Eaglesmith is now only playing select and curated dates, as a duo with Tif Ginn, as well as with The Velvet Frogs. He continues to push boundaries, defy expectations, and remind us why he's one of the most enduring and enigmatic figures in modern music. Whether you're a longtime devotee or a newcomer to his world, one things for sure: Fred Eaglesmith is still writing his story, one unforgettable song at a time.

### Score

- **Total:** 14/30
- **Rarity:** 4/10
- **Uniqueness:** 8/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** A niche sapphic tea-dance/community queer fundraiser (second run, likely monthly) — not terribly rare but special to the sapphic community. High 'main character' energy for its audience and benefits Our Voice (+Asheville-unique queer vibe bonus), but small-scale basement venue keeps magnitude low.

### Description

### Description

Join us at Jack of the Wood for some darts, old-time music, drinks, and excellent food if you're hungry.

**AI Summary:** Evening of sensual group cuddling emphasizing consensual touch, clear boundaries, and slow intimate connection in a ticketed adults only space hosted by Asheville Cuddle Collective; participants reserve limited spots online.

### Description

Please note- If you want to attend this event you need to purchase a ticket- We advertise in many places and only paid tickets will reserve your space.[ ](https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/jan-17th-an-evening-of-sensual-snuggles)**[CLICK HERE TO PURCHASE YOU TICKET AND RESERVE YOUR SPACE FOR THIS EVENT.](https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/jan-17th-an-evening-of-sensual-snuggles)**[ ](https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/jan-17th-an-evening-of-sensual-snuggles)

**What is a Sensual Snuggle Event?**
This is a sweet & welcoming event where we practice and use verbal consent to connect and share touch. We talk about boundaries and practice both saying and receiving a “no”. In this space it is common to see people cuddle, share massage, have their hair brushed, kiss, expose nipples, play, laugh, cry, and be vulnerable. This is a sober space where we can relax and connect with other humans who are seeking touch based connection.
We strive for this to be a safe event. Safe touch enhances our ability to connect with and trust people. When we are in a space of safety, we are able to relax, feel comfort, and be vulnerable.

**Our Agreements:**
1- We ask for what we want an wait for a yes before touching others.
2- We say no if we don’t want to do something.
3- We try to receive a no with grace and not take it personally.
4- We arrive on time, clean (as scent free as possible), and sober.
5- We keep our pants/shorts on at this event. (Tops are optional; this is a sensual space, not a sexual space.)
6- We are here to connect with others. Connection can be verbal, platonic, or spicy!
7- We welcome diversity. Isms and Phobias are not welcome here!

**Who should attend:**
People who are interested in safely exploring touch and sensuality with strangers. This includes people who are single, people who are not single, couples, folks who are new to town and looking for connection, people of all/any genders and sexual orientations, people of all ages (18 and up). People who un...

- **Total:** 9/30

- **Uniqueness:** 4/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Single-night intimate acoustic set at a small kava lounge — easily missable but not rare for this venue (many similar listings). Pleasant, mellow main‑character vibe but otherwise a standard local lounge show with a very small, hyper-local draw.

**AI Summary:** Intimate acoustic set from a soulful vocalist in a cozy kava lounge, delivering warm, mellow vocals and guitar backed songs in a low lit, relaxed listening atmosphere.

**AI Summary:** Casual coffee conversations among atheists and secular humanists Sunday mornings (10 AM–noon), with book-club meetings twice a month at Standard Pizza and monthly Wednesday meetups at local breweries.

### Description

**We hope you will come meet some of the group** this coming **Sunday morning** **(10AM - noon)** or some time soon. We meet every Sunday at **Earth Fare's cafe** for just conversation among like-minded non-believers.
In addition, two Sundays per month we also have a **Book Club** that meets at **Standard Pizza on Biltmore**. We also have Wednesday evening meetings at either **Boodas Brewing or Trailside in Hendersonville** once a month. You should receive emails about each of those events and are welcome to attend.
Please sign up here in Meetup to receive notices about our activities. There are no dues. Thanks!

Our newly-formed group has 100+ members already. Our conversation groups are usually 10-15 people and have been excellent. We chat about atheism, but also about **other things that are not related to religion** etc at all.

**None of us believe in religion.** Some of us wonder if "the universe" or something energy-related affects our lives, while others feel that someday science will be able to explain time-without-beginning and other mysteries.

**Until further notice our Sunday get togethers will be 10AM - noon** at the **cafe at Earth Fare.** RSVP is requested but not required.

The address is **66 Westgate Pkwy, Asheville**. **Earth Fare** is a large and excellent "health supermarket". It's in the Westgate Shopping Center, which is right off Patton after crossing the bridge on 240 West. Earth Fare is at the far end of the parking lot. There is plenty of free parking. They have a **very nice cafe** that you'll find off to the left after entering the store. The grocery area also has some good deals - see https://www.earthfare.com/#about

We’ll have a sign so you can see what table(s) we are using. Bringing kids and dogs is not recommended.

Because we appreciate each participant, **suggestions and input are welcome**. Let's start with **your input** about these things...

## Parental Advisory Drag Brunch

**Date:** Sunday, January 18, 2026 at 11:00 AM

**Location:** Cultivated Cocktails Distillery Tavern, Asheville, NC (28801)

**Organizer:** Cultivated Cocktails Distillery Tavern

**Source:** EXPLORE_ASHEVILLE (ID: ea-30243)

**Tags:** Dining, LGBTQ+, Drag Brunch, Cabaret Comedy, Brunch Cocktails, Distillery Tavern

### Score

- **Total:** 16/30
- **Rarity:** 5/10
- **Uniqueness:** 7/10
- **Magnitude:** 4/10
- **Reasoning:** A one-date drag brunch that's part of a common local drag circuit (monthly/seasonal feel) — high-energy, campy cabaret and inclusive LGBTQ+ vibe gives it strong 'main character' appeal (Asheville-weird bonus), but it's hosted at a small distillery tavern so the draw is local/venue-scale.

**AI Summary:** High energy drag brunch with campy cabaret performances and lip-sync comedy, paired with brunch bites and craft cocktails for a boozy, celebratory, inclusive midday crowd.

### Description

A Connection Practice is a meeting to practice your skills in listening and connecting with others. No conversation topic is off limits. The only objective of the meeting is to feel a genuine sense of connection by the time it's over, and the only rule is that we promise to not give each other advice.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates.

## Introduction to creativity journaling

**Date:** Sunday, January 18, 2026 at 4:00 PM

**Location:** 1 Roberts Street, The Hatchery Building, Suite 201 - Zen Mountain Studio, 1 Roberts Street, The Hatchery Building, Suite 201 - Zen Mountain Studio, Asheville, NC (28806)

**Organizer:** Asheville Creativity Journaling Meetup Group

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP (ID: 312579634)

**Tags:** Education, Meditation, Wellness, Creativity Journaling, Song Centered, Guided Meditation Writing, Beginner Friendly, Small Group Studio

### Score

- **Total:** 9/30
- **Rarity:** 2/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** A small, free meetup-style creativity journaling workshop in a studio — clearly recurring (multiple similar dates), so low urgency. It’s a niche, song-focused meditation/writing session (moderately interesting but not wildly novel), and a hyper-local small-group draw rather than a professional/regional headliner.

**AI Summary:** Quiet guided meditation and journaling exercises coax out lyric ideas and the 'shy inner voice' for song-focused creativity, with listening practices and writing prompts in a small studio forum for artists.

### Description

* **We’ll explore the use of journaling and meditation in creative work. We’ll nurture the song within and see what that shy inner voice wants to tell us. It is about listening first – sensing what wants to become. This is a forum where artists can drop beneath the busy surface mind and listen for what's trying to emerge.**

**There are moments in our lives, there are moments in a day, when we seem to see beyond the usual--become clairvoyant. We reach then into reality. Such are the moments of our greatest happiness. Such are the moments of our greatest vision....At such times there is a song going on within us, a song to which we listen. It fills us with surprise. We marvel at it. We would continue to hear it. But few are capable of holding themselves in the state of listening to their song. Intellectuality steps in and as the song within us is of the utmost sensitiveness, it retires in the presence of the cold, material intellect. It is aristocratic and will not associate itself with the commonplace--and we fall back and become our ordinary selves. Yet we live in the memory of these songs which in moments of intellectual inadvertence have been possible to us. They are the pinnacles of our experience and it is the desire to express these intimate sensations, this song from within, which motivates the masters of all art.**
**\- Robert Henri from The Art**

Love and Lilght,
Celeste

*Please note that, due to my holiday travels, this 12/07 meeting will be the last meeting until January the 18th.*

On Sunday, December 7th at 4 to 6PM, as usual, we will sit together in meditation, invite personal sharing, and discuss and watch short segments of inspiration videos in my West Asheville home.
I can accommodate up to 10 people. So far our groups average about 4 or 5.
Remember to text or call to let me know you are coming and/or to get the address.

Remember, we are now meeting at my home in West Asheville - **Please call 541-799-5289 for address if needed and text me if you are planning on coming as there is a space limit of 10 people.**

I would like to offer 3 videos for this coming Sunday's 11/16 gathering.
I was realizing that the first 2 are somewhat complimentary:

#1 is another Dr David Clements interview with a slightly more scientific focus. He invites us into Unconditional Love and Joy through diving deeply into our Source identity.
https://youtu.be/vw00F6jof9Q?si=r6KXcnCocb3m7JGD

#2 Valarie Kaur offers us the path of the Sage Warrior and invites us into Unconditional Love and Joy through a deep dive into meeting our human and global challenges.
https://youtu.be/8JGAza0HnVw?si=rq9URxLpy1zGO0E_

It felt like exploring how we may integrate both Truths into our lives...

**Tags:** Spiritual, Meditation, Community, New Moon, Intention Setting, Inclusive Circle, Grounding Practice, All Genders Welcome

### Score

- **Total:** 11/30
- **Rarity:** 4/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Monthly New Moon circle — relatively easy to catch (monthly), a warm inclusive spiritual practice (moderately distinctive) held at a small local wellness space, so low regional draw.

**AI Summary:** Gentle grounding meditation and communal intention setting in an inclusive New Moon circle welcoming all bodies and genders, creating a sacred reflective space to align energies and manifest intentions for the month ahead.

### Description

Join us for a welcoming and inclusive New Moon Circle, where all bodies and all genders are invited to participate in this sacred gathering. This event is a beautiful opportunity to pause, reflect, and align with the energies of the New Moon—a powerful time for setting intentions and manifesting our desires for the month ahead.

Our circle will begin with a grounding meditation, creating a space for relaxation and inner connection. Together, we will share our personal intentions, holding space for one another in a supportive and non-judgmental environment. We will also dive into the astrological influences of the New Moon and other energetic currents, discussed in an accessible way that resonates with both beginners and seasoned practitioners.

By the end of the circle, you will leave with greater clarity and purpose, feeling empowered to take inspired action as you move forward into the new lunar cycle. Whether you're new to moon rituals or a longtime participant, this circle will offer insight, connection, and a sense of renewal.

Come as you are—everyone is welcome. Let’s harness the magic of the New Moon together!

Bring your friends and remember to carpool!

**AI Summary:** Hands on colored pencil and marker drawing paired with guided listening exercises to deepen interpersonal connection; meetings prioritize authentic sharing, a strict no advice rule, and sanitized supplies or bring your own materials.

### Description

You will be provided with your sanitized supplies, or feel free to bring your own colored pencils, markers, or other art supplies to express yourself during this Connection Practice Meeting.

A Connection Practice is a meeting to practice your skills in listening and connecting with others. No conversation topic is off limits. The only objective of the meeting is to feel a genuine sense of connection by the time it's over, and the only rule is that we promise to not give each other advice.

One seeker always facilitates the meeting (to guide the conversation, manage time, and introduce different exercises to help the group feel connected), and another always volunteers as Space Owl (to step aside with anyone who has a big emotional experience and needs 1-on-1 connection).

There is no hierarchy in Connection Practice meetings, and everyone is encouraged to share equally and freely, including the person who facilitates. All connection practices are free of charge.

### Score

- **Total:** 5/30

- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Weekly recurring event - happens every week.

**AI Summary:** Sixty-minute heads-down writing sprints for novels, poetry, song lyrics, resumes, or reports, preceded by quick introductions; communal quiet focus in a cozy cafe setting fosters accountability and boosts productivity.

### Description

Shut Up & Write!

**Here's how it works.** Show up at or before 6:00. At 6:00, we do some quick introductions. Afterward, for a full 60 minutes (I'll set a timer!) we are heads-down writing. Writing what? A novel? You bet. Some poetry? Sure. Song lyrics? Your resume? That report you need to get to your boss before 8 AM or you'll *need* *to write* that resume? All of the above and more. Just shut up and write.

Surrounding ourselves with other writers who are busy putting words onto page (physical or virtual) keeps us all accountable and focused.

When the timer goes off, we'll check-in with each other and see how it went. Afterward, feel free to stay to chat and get to know your fellow writers, or keep writing, or take off.

Socializing is optional and will happen after (or briefly before) the focused writing. This is a safe space to work on your craft. No one will read or critique your writing.

For more information about our events, visit [https://shutupwrite.com](https://shutupwrite.com).

**What to Expect**

* Roughly 15 minutes of introductions
* 60 minutes of focused writing (somebody set a timer)!
* Afterward, optional socializing

**Being late is okay:** Just show up and get settled, then check in with the host after the session. (Look for the person with the Shut Up & Write sign).

**What Should I Bring?**

* Whatever you need to be able to write!
* Earbuds/earplugs if you want to block ambient noise.

**Other Important Details:**

HOSTS: This is a multi-host event, so most of the time there will be a host present. If we are unlucky and no host can attend, please find each other and self-organize. Pay attention to the event chat and comments to see who is available.

WI-FI: Yes!

PARKING: Street parking in metered spots is free after 6pm. Closest municipal garages ($2/hour) are Wall St. & Coxe Street/Sears Alley.

**Location:** Energetic Experiences, 81 Weaverville Rd Suite 2, Asheville, NC (28804)

**Organizer:** Awakening Asheville

**Price:** $11

**Source:** MEETUP (ID: 312539407)

### Score

- **Total:** 13/30
- **Rarity:** 4/10
- **Uniqueness:** 7/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Seasonal, not rare (many similar astro/ritual offerings) so mid-low rarity. Strong niche 'Main Character' vibe — guided astrology + movement + journaling feels specialized and gets an Asheville-weird boost. Small, local studio event with limited draw, so low magnitude.

**AI Summary:** Astrology-led ritual blending guided meditation, somatic movement, and reflective journaling to set intentions for Aquarius season; bring your birth chart for personalized insights and energetic grounding.

### Description

When the sun moves into a new sign an energetic shift occurs. Learning to connect, listen, and set intentions with the sun is a beautiful way to add ritual into your life.

Aquarius season is from 1/19-2/18 and for this gathering we'll discuss the Astrological happenings of the zodiac season and where it will impact you personally (birth chart recommended).

As with all energetic shifts, getting into your body is important. Together we'll ground into the energy through meditation and movement themed around the season. Accommodations/Modification can be made for ALL bodies, come as you are.

We'll close out with time for journaling and optional sharing.

Price: $11

- **Reasoning:** Weekly recurring event - happens every week.

**AI Summary:** Alchemical, improvisational jazz from a four-piece exploring 'quintessence' through original compositions and through-composed passages, unfolding in an intimate cocktail-lounge setting for attentive, late-night listeners.

### Description

Sanders, Boyd, Page & Hall distill the pure essence of improvisational expression, converging as alchemists of sound, transmuting musical elements into their most essential forms. This quartet embodies the philosophical concept of quintessence—the fifth element beyond earth, air, fire, and water—representing the fundamental substance from which all musical reality springs. Their original compositions crystallize the essential qualities of diverse influences, oscillating between through-composed musical themes, groove-based soul explorations, traditional jazz-influenced pieces, Americana-inspired peaceful melodicism, world music influences, free jazz adventures, and occasional forays into cacophonous noise music. Through years of improvisational study, they've learned to access that rarefied space where genres dissolve into pure creative energy. In this musical laboratory, Sanders' guitar becomes a conduit for universal vibration, Boyd's reeds channel the breath of consciousness itself, Page's bass provides the fundamental frequency of existence, while Hall's percussion creates the rhythmic heartbeat of the cosmos. Will Boyd - Sax, Flute, Clarinet, EWI Zack Page - Acoustic & Electric Bass Alan Hall - Drums Jay Sanders - Guitar and Effects Every Monday and Tuesday, Little Jumbo brings live jazz to your ears. littlejumbobar.com “Simply put, Little Jumbo should be at the top of your list of places for cocktails in Asheville. The drinks and service are both top-notch, and the atmosphere is reminiscent of a relaxed speakeasy, without a trace of the pretention that can sometimes be found in such places.” ~ The SmokyMountains.com Local Expert Team

## Jesse James DeConto

**Date:** Wednesday, January 21, 2026 at 6:00 PM

**Price:** Free

**Source:** LIVE_MUSIC_AVL (ID: 64823)

**Tags:** Live Music, Beer, Nightlife, Indie Folk, Singer Songwriter, Upright Bass, Taproom Show, Sing Along

### Score

- **Total:** 13/30
- **Rarity:** 2/10
- **Uniqueness:** 6/10
- **Magnitude:** 5/10
- **Reasoning:** Free taproom singer‑songwriter set at Pisgah Brewing — part of a regular brewery music lineup (low missability) but elevated by trumpet/keys/upright bass and communal sing‑alongs; solid local/professional draw rather than a regional headliner.

**AI Summary:** Plaintive singer-songwriter ballads that bloom into full-band indie-folk with trumpet, keys, percussion and upright bass, building to communal sing-alongs in Pisgah Brewing’s Black Mountain taproom during an evening set.

### Description

Bar: 4PM | Deli: 4PM | Music: 6PM Initially, it’s just DeConto’s voice and guitar and it’s plaintive, tuneful and could be a great song played out just like this. However, the subtle addition of extra instrumentation – trumpet, keys, percussion and upright bass – adds depth and texture and gives DeConto the foundation from which his vocal can soar with emotion. ‘Sometimes, Brothers’ grows and the backing vocals turn the song into a sing-along by the end. … It does indeed bloom. Founded in 2005, Pisgah is known for producing some of the most sought after craft ales in Western North Carolina. Pisgah Brewing Company currently operates the new indoor taproom & deli, with live music several days a week, plus an open air outdoor bar in the summer and fall months.

- **Reasoning:** Monthly themed book club + wine tasting at a small local wine shop — a pleasant, low‑key community event that’s recurring (monthly) so not highly missable.

Come join us for a fun afternoon sampling some wine(s) and talking about books. As always, the book can be fiction or non-fiction ..... whatever......just so that it somehow involves whatever topic we've chosen for the month. And if you just want to join us to hear about the books we've read but haven't read any yet yourself, come along anyhow. You'll have a chance then to suggest a topic for us to read books on next time.

**Location:** Highland Brewing, 12 Charlotte Highway, Asheville, NC (28806)

**Organizer:** AVL Digital Nomads

**Price:** Free

**Source:** MEETUP (ID: 312551335)

### Score

- **Total:** 14/30
- **Rarity:** 4/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 5/10
- **Reasoning:** Annual New Year kickoff for AVL Digital Nomads at Highland Brewing — limited one-night seasonal mixer with structured icebreakers (so slightly missable) but otherwise a fairly standard local brewery networking event; good community draw but not a major or novel production.

**AI Summary:** High-energy mixer for digital nomads and remote professionals, pairing craft beer and upbeat music with quick icebreakers and structured networking to spark local collaborations and casual after-hours community building.

### Description

## Toby's Briar Society - Inaugural Gathering

**Date:** Thursday, January 22, 2026 at 6:00 PM

**Organizer:** Casablanca Cigar Bar

**Price:** $15

**Source:** EVENTBRITE (ID: 1979122677204)

**Tags:** Nightlife, Community, Pipe Club, Cigar Lounge, Inaugural Gathering, Social Smoking, Pipe Enthusiasts

### Score

- **Total:** 16/30
- **Rarity:** 7/10
- **Uniqueness:** 7/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** An inaugural, one-off pipe‑club launch makes it more missable than a weekly meetup (rarity=7). It’s a niche, stylish cigar‑lounge social with good 'main character' vibes for pipe enthusiasts (unique=7). However it’s a small, hyper‑local gathering at a neighborhood cigar bar in Hendersonville, so draw is limited (magnitude=2).

**AI Summary:** Aromatic pipe tobacco and plush leather seating create a relaxed, late-night cigar lounge vibe for an inaugural pipe club gathering — a social meetup for pipe enthusiasts, collectors, and conversationalists.

### Score

- **Total:** 11/30
- **Rarity:** 2/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 4/10
- **Reasoning:** Free taproom bluegrass at Pisgah Black Mountain — a solid, recurring local music gig with good local/genre appeal but low urgency and modest draw in a small brewery setting.

**AI Summary:** Evening bluegrass set blending traditional and contemporary styles, honed in restaurants and clubs; a Columbia area quartet delivers tight acoustic string arrangements and lively harmonies for a casual brewery taproom crowd.

### Description

Bar: 4PM | Deli: 4PM | Music: 7PM Carolina Bluegrass Style is a unique blend of young and old, past, present, and perhaps the future of bluegrass music. When Tommy Thomas asked Tyler Chasteen, Don Ashley, and David Prosser to get together and play some music, they had no idea they would be creating a new group. Yet, the popularity of the group has surpassed all expectations. While all the members of the band live in the Columbia, SC area, they have been honing their sound in restaurants, clubs, and other venues around Asheville, NC. Founded in 2005, Pisgah is known for producing some of the most sought after craft ales in Western North Carolina. Pisgah Brewing Company currently operates the new indoor taproom & deli, with live music several days a week, plus an open air outdoor bar in the summer and fall months.

### Description

ALL AGESPARTIALLY SEATED SHOW (guaranteed seating AND standing room only tickets are available at checkout) CHATHAM COUNTY LINE Launched a little more than twenty years ago in Raleigh, North Carolina, Chatham County Line built a devoted local following on the strength of their genre-bending live show-an intoxicating blend of bluegrass, folk, country, and rock and roll-before breaking out internationally with their 2003 self-titled debut. In the years to come, the band would go on to release eight more critically acclaimed studio albums, top the Billboard Bluegrass Chart four times, collaborate with the likes of Judy Collins, Sharon Van Etten, and Norwegian star Jonas Fjeld, earn two gold records in Norway (where they were also twice nominated for the Spellemannprisen, Norway's equivalent of a Grammy), and share bills with everyone from Guy Clark and Lyle Lovett to Steve Martin & Martin Short and The Avett Brothers. NPR hailed the group as "a bridge between bluegrass traditions and a fresh interpretation of those influences," while Uncut lauded their "powerful melodies and gorgeous harmonies," and Pitchfork dubbed their music "timeless." The band's latest release, Hiyo, marks the band's first release since the departure of their longtime banjo player and serves as something of a reintroduction to the roots stalwarts, complete with new sounds, new collaborators, and a whole new lease on life. Recorded at Asheville's Echo Mountain studio with co-producer/engineer Rachael Moore (Kacey Musgraves, Robert Plant and Alison Krauss), the collection finds the trio-Dave Wilson (lead singer/guitarist), John Teer (fiddle/mandolin) and Greg Readling (bass/pedal steel), embracing change at every turn, experimenting with fresh sonic palettes and innovative approaches to their core instrumentation. The songwriting remains classic Chatham County Line here-rich, evocative tales of love and heartbreak, joy and sorrow, righteousness and revenge-but the settings have evolved to incorporat...

**Tags:** Wellness, Meditation, Sensory Integration, Trauma Informed, Somatic Practices, Guided Grounding

### Score

- **Total:** 12/30
- **Rarity:** 3/10
- **Uniqueness:** 7/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Regular community wellness offering (recurring at a small studio) so not urgent, but a niche trauma‑informed somatic/sensory immersion gives it high‑concept, main‑character energy; small local studio limits draw.

**AI Summary:** Deep somatic sensory immersion to recalibrate the nervous system through guided grounding, breathwork, and mindful body awareness. Trauma-informed facilitators lead experiential practices to reconnect sensation and movement for stress regulation and present moment embodiment.

### Description

**Sensory Immersion Night**
Have you explored sensory Exploration for your nervous system?
Our senses have a beautiful way of grounding us into the present moment but this can take some work. Our sensory world can also become disconnected when our nervous system has stayed in pattern loops from high levels of stress and/or trauma.

This is essentially a disconnect of mind and body. The sensory information we receive from the outside world, drives movement patterns in the body. So, if we’re constantly perceiving the world as unsafe, we will move in that way.

**How do we begin to correct this?**
We start the practice of reintegrating the senses. Meditating can be challenging when we’ve been in a heightened state, so exploring adding additional sensory input can help to get you out of attachment to your busy racing thoughts and into the feelings/sensations created in your body. The more you explore the five traditional senses more mindfully, the more you can perceive energy. The more energy you perceive, the more you feel connected to everything. Learning to express and move energy is vulnerable, but as the research shows, vulnerability is the key to personal freedom.

This evening will be all about tuning in and listening to your needs. This is a neurodivergent friendly space that honors consent and personal preferences.

**What to expect:**
mindful sensory exploration
stations to explore various sensory techniques
group meditation with added sensory input
Donation only/pay what you can

- **Rarity:** 8/10
- **Uniqueness:** 8/10
- **Magnitude:** 7/10
- **Reasoning:** One-off touring appearance by cult anti-comedy character at The Grey Eagle — high-concept, bewildering act with strong niche draw and regional venue scale.

**AI Summary:** Deadpan, anti-comedy stand-up with awkward satirical beats and cult-following appeal; an all-ages, fully seated evening by a relentlessly touring, character-driven comedian known for bewildering audiences and opening for Tenacious D.

### Description

ALL AGES FULLY SEATED SHOW LIMITED NUMBER OF PREMIUM SEATING TICKETS AVAILABLE NEIL HAMBURGER America's Funnyman Neil Hamburger is the hardest working comedian in existence, performing up to 399 shows a year internationally to critical acclaim and audience bewilderment. He has toured as the hand-picked opener for Tenacious D, Tim & Eric, and Faith No More, appeared on TV shows ranging from Tim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job! to Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and worked extensively with Tom Green on his internet talk show. Among his dozen or so albums and DVDs is the new LP release Neil Hamburger Present: Seasonal Depression Suite. "A phlegm-filled sack of putrid self-loathing, Neil Hamburger is the perfect satire of a slick, professional nightclub comedian. If you've ever suspected that behind the glossy veneer of fake bonhomie of those perma-smile acts lies an ugly, embittered, grotesque soul - well Hamburger is that demon made flesh. In some living Sisyphean hell, every night he dons his tuxedo, greases down his hair and ploughs through the vile set that disgusts even him, just so he can earn a three-piece chicken dinner. His contempt for his own pitiful existence is surpassed only for his contempt for the audience who compel him trudge through his despicable cavalcade of jokes. And my, these gags are certainly not for the faint of heart, as he plumbs the depths of depravity for the sake of a laugh." - Chortle (UK) "Hamburger is the clapped-out husk of a decorous Southern gentleman, now coughing in painful hacks, suppurating filth through his tuxedo, and her to tip a slurry of abuse all over celebrity and modern life.a combination of malignance and desiccated vaudeville." - The Guardian (UK) "Neil Hamburger remains the greatest comedian I've seen the greater majority of an audience walk out on.... No one was leaving their seats this evening though, as this peerless performer shocked and delighted in equal measure.... On the road for 12 years with scarcely a day off, Hamburg...

**AI Summary:** Detailed teachings on the Pure Land (Sukhāvati) and Amitābha’s Boundless Light, focusing on aspiration for rebirth and practical bodhisattva training to swiftly clear adventitious obscurations and actualize buddha qualities.

### Description

Dorlop Rinpoché, Dr. Lye will offer a weekend retreat at Urban Dharma in Asheville, North Carolina on the weekend of January 24 & 25 focused on Boundless Light Buddha (Amitabha) and his Realm of Bliss (Dewachen). This program will include a Boundless Light Buddha empowerment from "The Profound Intent of the Secret Essence Cycle of Dharmas" upheld in the Drikung Kagyu Lineage. 

Dr. Lye is offering this program to serve as a support for the Phowa Transmission that he offered a few months ago. Furthermore, Dr. Lye intends to offer a special focus on practices of the Lotus Family of the Secret Mantra (Vajrayana) in this coming year of 2026. 

So stay tuned for the announcement of a few more weekend programs on various deities and practices of this buddha-family. Those who are the desirous, possessive, controlling, creative, and discerning types have an affinity with the Lotus Family and its practices can help us clear the causes of suffering and achieve the causes of happiness in the most efficient and swift manner.

[NOTE: As this is a Vajrayana empowerment, please only attend if you understand that the Vajrayana path is based on training in pure perception. At the very least, initiates need to be ready to train in pure perception of the Vejrayana methods, of the teacher giving the empowerment and, of fellow initiates.]

This is a Zoom and in-person program.

Registration is required at:

More details on this program at the registration page.

Program attendance is by donation (as you are able).

Open Studio is a time when supplies and space will be available to create cards for your deck. You can drop in for a little while or stay the entire time. New and experienced practitioners welcome! While this is mainly time for independent creation, Michelle will be there to chat, answer questions, provide tips, and guide you through the process. If you’ve been curious about SoulCollage® this is a great way to get started.

Bring your water bottle and something to journal with. All other supplies will be provided.

**Materials Fee Contribution:** $5.00/Card

**About Your Guide:** I’m Michelle, an avid SoulCollage® Creatrix and lifelong educator who knows we are a network of connected humans. I believe we each have the capacity to improve our world by intentionally directing our individual and collective energies. I spend my time and energy expanding ideas, people, and communities that are lighting up the world with their precious energy. I’m excited to create with you!

**AI Summary:** High-contrast telescopic views of the Moon's craters and terminator line under pristine dark sky conditions, guided by observatory staff; hands on telescope viewing and lunar geology discussion.

- **Reasoning:** One-night, niche drum-&-bass vinyl night (not a weekly) so moderately missable (6). High-concept for Asheville’s electronic crowd and vinyl focus gives it local ‘weird’/cool factor (7). Held in the small Sly Grog lounge — hyper-local club draw rather than regional headliner (3).

**AI Summary:** Thunderous DnB DJ sets and vinyl transitions fill a dim lounge, driving dancers with rolling sub bass and rapid breakbeats; late night, club leaning energy for Asheville's electronic crowd.

- **Total:** 19/30

- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** Single-date touring indie bill in an intimate Static Age record‑shop — fairly missable (one‑off) but carries strong DIY/Asheville vibes and indie cool; small venue limits overall draw.

**AI Summary:** Hook driven indie tunes blending ’90s grunge and pop punk edges from Colleen Green alongside Cassie Ramone’s lo-fi garage songwriting, in an intimate Static Age Records record shop setting for fans of jangly DIY pop.

### Description

Colleen Green is a singer/songwriter from Lowell, MA. Influenced by ’90s grunge and pop punk but maintaining a style all her own, Green’s songs are immediately catchy, familiar, and essential.

### Score

- **Total:** 24/30
- **Rarity:** 9/10
- **Uniqueness:** 8/10
- **Magnitude:** 7/10
- **Reasoning:** A rare one-off tour stop by a cult-classic singer-songwriter returning after 50+ years with limited premium seating; intimate seated show at The Grey Eagle gives strong regional draw and notable ‘cult’ cachet.

**AI Summary:** Intimate seated set revisiting songs from Willis Alan Ramsey's storied 1972 self-titled album, blending singer-songwriter folk-rock and storytelling; all-ages audience hears material that influenced artists from the Allman Brothers to Lyle Lovett.

### Description

ALL AGES SEATED SHOW LIMITED NUMBER OF PREMIUM SEATING TICKETS AVAILABLE WILLIS ALAN RAMSEY Over 50 years after the release of his wildly influential self-titled album on Leon Russell's Shelter Records, Willis Alan Ramsey returns to touring. Ramsey's debut in 1972 earned scores of accolades from arti-sts ranging from The Allman Brothers to Lyle Lovett. The album was mined by many artists for their o_wn recordings including Jimmy Buffett's "The Ballad of Spider John", Jimmie Dale Gilmore's "Goodbye Old Missoula", Shawn Colvin's "Satin Sheets", Captain & Tennille's "Muskrat Candlelight/Love", Jerry Jeff Walker's "Northeast Texas Women", Waylon Jennings' "Satin Sheets", New Grass Revival's "Watermelon Man", and many more. Since that landmark first release, Ramsey has toured only occasionally, spending time instead with his family, honing his craft in Austin, Nashville and London, educating himself in the science of audio recording and composing new songs. His new material has received critical acclaim, including Lyle Lovett's recordings of "Sleepwalkin"', "North Dakota" and "That's Right (You're Not From Texas"), as well as Eric Clapton's recording of"Positively". Ramsey's infrequent personal appearances always gamer excitement among some of the top critics in the country as well as from his fellow artists: "His cozy, orderly, tiny-detail songs express a willful turnabout from hippie chaos, a visceral reaction particular to the early 1970's. His songs are sweet, emotionally guarded and often musically complex, fitting strains of melody together that seem as if they ought not connect, expertly using rhythmic displacement as the words and chords unspool .... Perfection is terrifying, and some of these songs felt spooky." - Ben Ratliff, The New York Times "You might have not seen him lately, but if you've listened to Shawn, Lyle or Jimmie Dale, you've heard him." - John T. Davis, The Austin American Statesman "Even if Ramsey had made a dozen more albums, this would still ...

### Score

- **Total:** 11/30
- **Rarity:** 5/10
- **Uniqueness:** 4/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Monthly community book-club meetup at Zillicoah Brewery to discuss Francis Spufford’s Cahokia Jazz — a small, local, low-cost/ticket event with a modest draw and a familiar format (brewery book club).

**AI Summary:** In-depth discussion of Francis Spufford's Cahokia Jazz, a longer-than-usual historical novel, with a month-plus reading window and evening meetup in Zillicoah Beer Co.'s brewery taproom; modest Meetup contributions welcomed.

### Description

For our next book club, we will be discussing Cahokia Jazz by Francis Spufford. I wasn't at the previous meeting to help with the selection of this book, but hopefully it works for people. It's longer than what we typically select too, but we do have over a month to read it, so we'll see how it goes!

**As we discussed recently, Meetup is charging the fee for running the group again. If you haven't contributed in a while, or feel like you could or want to contribute more, I appreciate any help and whatever you are comfortable with doing! Thank you so much for your help and for continuing to show and up and support the group. I look forward to seeing you at the next meeting. You're welcome to bring cash in person or send to my Venmo whenever! It's Tobias-Roth-2**

The description for the book reads:

A thrilling tale of murder and mystery in a city where history has run a little differently—from the bestselling author of *Golden Hill*.

In a city that never was, in an America that never was, on a snowy night at the end of winter, two detectives find a body on the roof of a skyscraper.

It's 1922, and Americans are drinking in speakeasies, dancing to jazz, stepping quickly to the tempo of modern times. Beside the Mississippi, the ancient city of Cahokia lives on—a teeming industrial metropolis, containing every race and creed. Among them, peace holds. Just about. But that body on the roof is about to spark off a week that will spill the city's secrets, and bring it, against a soundtrack of wailing clarinets and gunfire, either to destruction or rebirth.

The multiple-award-winning Francis Spufford returns, with a lovingly created, richly pleasure-giving, epically scaled tale set in the golden age of wicked entertainments.

- **Reasoning:** Weekly recurring event - happens every week.

**AI Summary:** Silent, timer driven 60 minute writing sprints in a cozy downtown coffee shop, pairing quick introductions with distraction-free focus for novelists, poets, lyricists, and professionals polishing resumes or reports.

### Description

Shut Up & Write!

**Here's how it works.** Show up at or before 6:00. At 6:00, we do some quick introductions. Afterward, for a full 60 minutes (I'll set a timer!) we are heads-down writing. Writing what? A novel? You bet. Some poetry? Sure. Song lyrics? Your resume? That report you need to get to your boss before 8 AM or you'll *need* *to write* that resume? All of the above and more. Just shut up and write.

Surrounding ourselves with other writers who are busy putting words onto page (physical or virtual) keeps us all accountable and focused.

When the timer goes off, we'll check-in with each other and see how it went. Afterward, feel free to stay to chat and get to know your fellow writers, or keep writing, or take off.

Socializing is optional and will happen after (or briefly before) the focused writing. This is a safe space to work on your craft. No one will read or critique your writing.

For more information about our events, visit [https://shutupwrite.com](https://shutupwrite.com).

**What to Expect**

* Roughly 15 minutes of introductions
* 60 minutes of focused writing (somebody set a timer)!
* Afterward, optional socializing

**Being late is okay:** Just show up and get settled, then check in with the host after the session. (Look for the person with the Shut Up & Write sign).

**What Should I Bring?**

* Whatever you need to be able to write!
* Earbuds/earplugs if you want to block ambient noise.

**Other Important Details:**

HOSTS: This is a multi-host event, so most of the time there will be a host present. If we are unlucky and no host can attend, please find each other and self-organize. Pay attention to the event chat and comments to see who is available.

WI-FI: Yes!

PARKING: Street parking in metered spots is free after 6pm. Closest municipal garages ($2/hour) are Wall St. & Coxe Street/Sears Alley.

### Score

- **Total:** 11/30
- **Rarity:** 2/10
- **Uniqueness:** 7/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** A regularly offered group reiki/sound bath at a small local studio—very missable/recurring (low rarity) but has niche, ‘Asheville-weird’ appeal (light language, crystal bowls) boosting uniqueness; small, hyper-local draw (low magnitude).

**AI Summary:** Immersive reiki and sound journey blending crystal singing bowls, koshi chimes, drum, and channeled light language to cultivate deep relaxation and energetic activation for body, mind, and soul.

### Description

Activate the light within is about holding space for you to rest your body and cultivate a deep sense of ease allowing your innate healing to take place.

Lauren will give the group reiki and combine sound with crystal singing bowls, koshi chimes and drum. Light language will also be incorporated throughout the journey.

These three healing modalities weave beautifully together creating a powerful activation within the body, mind and soul.

Description of light language: Channeled language that is understood on a soul level and bypasses the mind. It adjusts to the resonance of each person's vibrational needs in the moment, initiating, clearing, balancing, activating and aligning with a new vibration of wellbeing.

Description of energy healing: Healing techniques that gently clear stored traumas, stagnation, emotional blocks within the body and tissues. Energy healing restores the body, mind, and spirit back to natural balance and overall wellbeing.

Description of sound healing: The vibration of the bowls takes you into a meditative state. The sound healing waves penetrate on a cellular level resetting cellular patterns and bring harmony and balance to your body and soul.

When: Tuesday, January 27th
Time: 6:30pm-7:30pm
Sliding scale $15-35

**Lauren's Bio:**

As a certified Reiki Master, Advanced IET Practitioner, and Munay‑Ki Shamanic Practitioner, I blend deep knowledge of energetic systems with intuitive guidance.

My journey into healing led me to train in sound healing, vocal therapy, Ayurveda, and natural medicines—all central to my transformative approach. For nearly a decade, I’ve been channeling light language, a vibrational transmission that transcends words to spark profound energetic shifts.

I hold private sessions and lead group gatherings, always cultivating a safe, nurturing environment where deep healing and self‑discovery can unfold. I believe true healing occurs when we reconnect with our essence, release what no longer serves us, and step into ...

### Description

**Rooted Brotherhood Men's Council: Connection, Reflection & Support**

This Men’s Community Council is a welcoming space for men who value authenticity, growth, and meaningful connection with other conscious men.

Together, we gather in a confidential, respectful council to slow down, speak honestly, and listen deeply. Through guided reflection, open sharing, and presence-based practices, we explore our inner world, strengthen self-awareness, and support one another in navigating life’s challenges and transitions.

This council is not about fixing or performing. It’s about being real—showing up as you are, being witnessed without judgment, and offering grounded support from men committed to personal responsibility, emotional intelligence, and healthy masculinity.

**What you can expect:**

* A safe, confidential container led with care and integrity
* Opportunities for self-exploration and honest expression
* Deep listening, mutual respect, and brotherhood
* Support from men walking a conscious, growth-oriented path

**Who this is for:**
Men of all backgrounds who are open to self-inquiry, connection, and showing up with sincerity. No prior experience with men’s work or circles is required—only a willingness to be present and respectful.
Come as you are. Leave feeling more connected, grounded, and supported.

Please arrive 10-15 minutes early to get settled into the space as we will begin promptly at 7pm. Wear comfortable clothes, there are bolsters and yoga mats in the space to use for support while we are seated.

Suggested donation of $10-$20, reach out to Brian (brianshayes25@gmail.com) with any questions.

**Rooted Brotherhood is an inclusive men’s community dedicated to fostering authentic connection, growth, and support. Through circles, breathwork, movement, sacred combat, and other men’s work practices, we create a safe space where men feel seen, heard, and empowered to meet life’s challenges.**

**AI Summary:** Low-lit temple-style chanting and guided meditation rooted in Yungdrun Bön tradition, with tea, conversation, and Q&A in a monthly community gathering for beginners and experienced practitioners under Latri Nyima Dakpa Rinpoche's lineage.

### Description

Join us for our next Yeru Asheville Bön Practice Night, a monthly gathering to study and practice the Bön tradition of Tibet.

Whether you are new or experienced, you are warmly welcome!

**What to Expect**

* Time for tea, conversation, and community
* Traditional Bon practice (chanting, meditation, etc.)
* Q&A/discussion

**Our Tradition**
Yeru Asheville is part of the Yeru Bön Center, under the guidance of Latri Nyima Dakpa Rinpoche. We maintain traditional Yungdrun Bön practice, following the authentic texts, including varied practices of Sutra, Tantra, and Dzogchen.

**New to Bön?**
No experience is necessary. Come with curiosity and an open heart. You’re welcome to participate at your own pace. Families are also welcome.

### Score

- **Total:** 5/30
- **Rarity:** 1/10
- **Uniqueness:** 2/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** Weekly recurring event - happens every week.

**AI Summary:** Elemental, improvisational jazz from a tight quartet that distills sound into concentrated melodies and exploratory textures; original, through-composed pieces open into free improvisation in Little Jumbo’s intimate cocktail lounge setting.

### Description

Sanders, Boyd, Page & Hall distill the pure essence of improvisational expression, converging as alchemists of sound, transmuting musical elements into their most essential forms. This quartet embodies the philosophical concept of quintessence—the fifth element beyond earth, air, fire, and water—representing the fundamental substance from which all musical reality springs. Their original compositions crystallize the essential qualities of diverse influences, oscillating between through-composed musical themes, groove-based soul explorations, traditional jazz-influenced pieces, Americana-inspired peaceful melodicism, world music influences, free jazz adventures, and occasional forays into cacophonous noise music. Through years of improvisational study, they've learned to access that rarefied space where genres dissolve into pure creative energy. In this musical laboratory, Sanders' guitar becomes a conduit for universal vibration, Boyd's reeds channel the breath of consciousness itself, Page's bass provides the fundamental frequency of existence, while Hall's percussion creates the rhythmic heartbeat of the cosmos. Will Boyd - Sax, Flute, Clarinet, EWI Zack Page - Acoustic & Electric Bass Alan Hall - Drums Jay Sanders - Guitar and Effects Every Monday and Tuesday, Little Jumbo brings live jazz to your ears. littlejumbobar.com “Simply put, Little Jumbo should be at the top of your list of places for cocktails in Asheville. The drinks and service are both top-notch, and the atmosphere is reminiscent of a relaxed speakeasy, without a trace of the pretention that can sometimes be found in such places.” ~ The SmokyMountains.com Local Expert Team

Do you want to take your remote working game to the next level? Do you find yourself saying wtf is Manifesting Self??

Well, you’re not alone. Remote working is glamorous, and also presents itself with challenges not seen in the traditional office environment.

Manifesting Self may sound a little out there. Trust me. It’s not. Whether we’ve been in the remote space for years, since the pandemic, or just recently, I’m certain it has changed each of us in ways we never thought possible. Let’s explore that together. The highs, the lows, and everywhere in between. And from there experience growth.

We are so excited to see you, again or for the first time!

**Organizer:** Awakening Asheville

### Score

- **Total:** 14/30
- **Rarity:** 3/10
- **Uniqueness:** 8/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** An intimate Core Shamanism drum-journey that's very niche and carries the 'Asheville weird' vibe (+2 to uniqueness). However it's a recurring/local circle (many similar dates), so low missability, and it's hosted at a small community space so the draw is hyper-local.

**AI Summary:** Rhythmic drum guided Core Shamanism journeys into the lower, middle, and upper worlds, preceded by communal earth songs and chanting; bring a blanket, eye pillow, journal, and optional drum or crystal.

### Description

Exploring our consciousness and fostering relationships with our guides in the lower world, upper world, and middle worlds. Traveling in the tradition of Core Shamanism via drum beat.

Bring a blanket and eye pillow for journeying, a journal to capture insights, and a water bottle. You're welcome to bring a drum or any portable instrument that calls to you and a crystal to charge/clear on the altar and/or journey with. We jam and sing to the Earth from 6:15pm, and then start as promptly at 6:30 as possible.

Join us in-person only at The Well in West Asheville.

We also tend to enjoy a closing ceremony at the end with a little group magic! Sometimes that takes us a little bit over time so we may end around 8:45-9ish. Participation is optional if you need to skeedattle sooner!

Snacks are provided for grounding and fellowship afterwards.

*Beginners and advancing practitioners alike are welcome to this Circle!*

Cost: $20-30

*To learn more, [journey here](https://liminalyoga.com/shamanic-journeying/)!*

### Description

ALL AGES SEATED SHOW LIMITED NUMBER OF PREMIUM SEATING TICKETS AVAILABLE THE CODY SISTERS The Cody Sisters band is the very heart of contemporary acoustic Folk and Bluegrass music in Colorado, the United States and the UK. Their propulsive instrumental solos and warm harmonies combine to grip the listener. Along with their bass player Will Pavilonis, sisters Megan (guitar, mandolin, vocals) and Maddie (guitar, banjo, vocals) have forged a new sound that has no equivalent match in the acoustic world today. In May of 2023, The Cody Sisters released their self-titled EP marking a new beginning for the band. It is their first release since parting ways with their former image of "young girls in a family band" and it portrays a sense of maturity and musical understanding that reveals a new dimension to their artistic expression. They set out to explore new sounds and styles while still holding true to their bluegrass roots, and they have done just that. This new music is an invitation to connect, to feel, and to journey together through original lyrics and captivating instrumental arrangements. The Cody Sisters have a sound that is original, exhilarating, and heartwarming all at the same time. With strong ties to traditional American acoustic music, they continue to stun their audiences both in the US and abroad.

## THE OCEAN BLUE: Frigid Winter Days Tour with Brian Tighe of The Hang Ups

**Date:** Thursday, January 29, 2026 at 8:00 PM

**Location:** Wortham Center for the Performing Arts, Asheville, NC (28806)

**Organizer:** Wortham Center for the Performing Arts

**Price:** Ticketed

**Source:** EXPLORE_ASHEVILLE (ID: ea-28830)

**Tags:** Live Music, Alternative Rock, Jangle Pop, 80s Band, Guest Brian Tighe

### Score

- **Total:** 22/30
- **Rarity:** 8/10

- **Magnitude:** 7/10
- **Reasoning:** A touring, nostalgia-tinged '80s college-rock act with a special guest — a one-off Asheville stop at the Wortham Center (a major regional venue). Limited date makes it missable; solid main-character nostalgia but not stadium-level.

**AI Summary:** Jangly, melancholic alternative rock anchored by shimmering guitars and hook-driven college-radio singles, plus tour guest Brian Tighe of The Hang Ups for a nostalgic 1980s-tinged evening.

### Description

Getting their start as teenagers in the late ‘80s in Hershey, PA, The Ocean Blue released their self-titled debut on the famed Sire Records label that launched many of their most beloved bands in the U.S., including the Smiths, Echo & the Bunnymen, and the Pretenders. Embraced by alternative radio and MTV, the band quickly made their mark with early singles “Between Something And Nothing,” “Drifting, Falling,” and “Ballerina Out of Control,” each Top Ten hit on U.S. college and Billboard’s Modern Rock Radio charts.

### Description

Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center presents Dialogue: Lindenfeld + Lindenfeld, an exhibition celebrating the works of mother-daughter artists, Lore Kadden Lindenfeld and Naomi Lindenfeld. Lore, who attended and graduated from Black Mountain College in the 1940s, made a career as a textile designer and educator while continuing to create weavings, fiber collages, artist books, and drawings. Her daughter Naomi creates colored clay objects that are tactile, useful, and visually complex.

- **Reasoning:** Weekly recurring event - happens every week.

**AI Summary:** Resonant crystal gong immersion led by master gong player David Heiss, using deep clearing tones to reset the nervous system and guide restful meditative states; includes a brief astrology overview to frame the journey.

### Description

Join us for a relaxing sound bath meditation led by David Heiss, Master gong player and sound healing musician. David has been playing gongs and facilitating sound healing journeys since 2012. You can learn more about his work at [​https://starsounds.love](https://www.starsounds.love/)

Leave the week's stress behind as you relax and reset your nervous system with this special clearing crystal gong bath.

We will begin with a brief overview of the current astrology aspects in our sky. Then enjoy a powerful yet relaxing 45 min. gong meditation followed by an integration.

When the gong sings, you listen. You listen listens with every cell of your body. You hear it and feel it. You begin to sense more. The obscure sounds leave your brain guessing and eventually surrenders to the soundwave as you begin to relax, feel and heal. The vibrational frequencies can awaken stagnant energy. The experience is like a personal dream. There are moments during a gong meditation where the subconscious can become more conscious, where illumination and insight follows.

Suggested donations for this event are $20-40. Donations can be made at the event via cash or Venmo.

Please bring any comfort items you may desire: blankets, pillows, bolsters, eye mask, etc. We do not yet have enough community items for everyone.

* The event is from 6 - 7:30 p.m.

### Score

- **Total:** 15/30
- **Rarity:** 5/10
- **Uniqueness:** 8/10
- **Magnitude:** 2/10
- **Reasoning:** A recurring (likely monthly) women-only ceremonial bonfire — fairly missable but time-sensitive (monthly). Strong high-concept, very Asheville spiritual vibe (Asheville-weird bonus applied), yet it's a small, hyper-local community ritual in Weaverville (low draw).

**AI Summary:** Women’s fire circle around a ceremonial bonfire in Weaverville’s Rocky Hollow, guiding participants through breathwork, song, and intention setting to discover, connect, and renew within a supportive sacred circle community.

## Jan. 30th "Dine with Divas" Drag Dinner Show

**Date:** Friday, January 30, 2026 at 7:00 PM

### Score

- **Total:** 22/30
- **Rarity:** 8/10
- **Uniqueness:** 9/10
- **Magnitude:** 5/10
- **Reasoning:** One-night, ticketed drag celebrity-impersonator dinner produced by local Bearded Lady—missable one-off (rarity=8). Campy, cabaret-style tribute has high "main character" energy and earns an Asheville-weird boost (+2 to unique=9). Held at Highland Brewing (established local venue) so solid local draw but not a regional headliner (magnitude=5).

**AI Summary:** Sequined drag celebrity impersonators deliver campy tribute sets to legendary music icons over plated dinner at Highland Brewing Company, blending cabaret style lip sync and live performance with community focused production by Bearded Lady Productions.

### Description

Asheville’s only drag celebrity impersonator dinner show is back—and it’s serving legendary music icons with a side of sequins.

**Price:** Ticketed

### Score

- **Total:** 16/30
- **Rarity:** 5/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 6/10
- **Reasoning:** Annual, long-running (38th) USCF-rated chess tournament — not easily missable but recurring each year (rarity 5). Solid niche appeal for competitive players and spectators but not a bizarre or high-production spectacle (unique 5). Held in a hotel ballroom with a regional draw of rated players and multiple rounds — larger than a meetup but not a major touring/headliner event (magnitude 6).

**AI Summary:** US Chess Federation rated Swiss tournament requiring USCF membership and entry fee, held in the Crowne Plaza hotel ballroom with free spectator access and multiple timed rounds for rated players.

**Organizer:** The Orange Peel

**Price:** Ticketed

### Score

- **Total:** 20/30
- **Rarity:** 7/10
- **Uniqueness:** 6/10
- **Magnitude:** 7/10
- **Reasoning:** Well-known touring Americana trio playing The Orange Peel — a mid-size, ticketed regional draw. Limited tour stop (two-night run nearby) makes it missable but not ultra-rare; solid, crowd-pleasing roots show rather than an unusually quirky or massive stadium event.

**AI Summary:** Soulful Americana sets blending acoustic guitar, dobro, and subtle electric textures with tight three-part harmonies; mid-size Orange Peel crowd for an 18+ night of roots-folk storytelling and groove.

### Score

- **Total:** 12/30
- **Rarity:** 4/10
- **Uniqueness:** 5/10
- **Magnitude:** 3/10
- **Reasoning:** Intimate record‑store show featuring a touring Nashville indie singer — pleasant one‑off but not rare (Static Age hosts many similar nights). Musically interesting/indie‑leaning (solid 'main character' vibe) but small, hyper‑local draw at a tiny venue.

**AI Summary:** Raw, poetic indie rock blending folk inspired storytelling and experimental textures, centered on Hana Eid’s vulnerable debut EP I Exist Because You Say So; intimate sets from Headringer, Max Langlinais, and Hook of Moon.

### Description
