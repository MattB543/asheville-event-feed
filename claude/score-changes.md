Here are subtle adjustments:

## Overscored — Suggested Changes

**Grove Park Inn Gingerbread Display**
- Current: Rarity 7, Unique 10, Magnitude 8 = **25**
- Adjustment: Drop Unique from 10 → 8 (annual tradition diminishes novelty)
- New Score: **23**

**Thomas Dambo's Trolls**
- Current: Rarity 8, Unique 7, Magnitude 7 = **22**
- Adjustment: Drop Rarity from 8 → 5 (permanent installation with rotating tours, not a limited event)
- New Score: **19**

**Hot In Herre: 2000s Dance Party**
- Current: Rarity 8, Unique 7, Magnitude 8 = **23**
- Adjustment: Drop Rarity from 8 → 6 and Magnitude from 8 → 7 (themed DJ nights happen regularly; free entry limits exclusivity)
- New Score: **20**

## Underscored — Suggested Change

**Willis Alan Ramsey**
- Current: Rarity 9, Unique 8, Magnitude 7 = **24**
- Adjustment: Bump Unique from 8 → 9 (50+ year gap since his only album is genuinely mythical in folk/Americana circles)
- New Score: **25**

This would move Willis Alan Ramsey into a tie for #1, which feels earned for a truly once-in-a-lifetime appearance.
